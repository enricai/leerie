## 0. Install surface

Leerie ships two install paths. Both ultimately invoke the on-disk
`leerie` launcher; the difference is who put it there and how the
user reaches it. The launcher itself is a portable bash script —
the host needs neither Python nor `uv`. Everything Python lives
inside the container (DESIGN §6 / §0.5 below).

### Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Single-plugin marketplace manifest. Makes the repo itself discoverable via `/plugin marketplace add enricai/leerie` from inside Claude Code. Points at `.` so Claude Code reads the sibling `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Existing plugin manifest (commands, skills, metadata). The `version` field is the single source of truth for `leerie --version`. |
| `scripts/install.sh` | The `curl \| bash` shell installer. Preflight (git/claude/curl) → runtime preflight (colima on macOS, nerdctl+containerd on Linux) → clone → symlink → verify. Self-contained bash; deps: `bash`, `curl`, `git`. |
| `leerie` (launcher) | Portable bash. Symlink-walks to its own location, runs the per-OS runtime preflight, builds the leerie image once per version, and execs `nerdctl run` with TTY flags adapted via `[ -t 0 ]` (see §0.5). Passes `--cgroupns=host` so the container shares the host VM's cgroup namespace — required for cgroup v2 process enrollment (nerdctl's default `--cgroupns=private` + `nsdelegate` blocks non-root `cgroup.procs` writes; see DESIGN §6 *Memory containment*). Fast paths for `--version` and `config` skip container startup. Per-run auth/config is staged into a fresh `mktemp -d "$HOME/.cache/leerie/cfg-XXXXXX"` (`$STAGE`); a `rm -rf "$STAGE"` EXIT trap is registered **immediately after the mktemp** (before the ~250-line stage-assembly block, which contains an `exit 1`) so an early exit can't leak the dir, and a best-effort startup sweep (`find "$HOME/.cache/leerie" -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'cfg-*' -mtime +1 -exec rm -rf`) reclaims dirs leaked by trap-bypassing exits (SIGKILL / OOM / `nerdctl kill`). Because `-mtime` tests the cfg dir's own top-level mtime — which freezes at staging-completion (the running container's writes into `$STAGE/.claude/*` do NOT bump it) — a background keepalive (`while :; do touch "$STAGE"; sleep 3600; done &`, killed by the same EXIT trap) freshens the live dir hourly so a genuinely long-running run (e.g. one auto-resuming across rate-limit backoffs) is never mistaken for stale and deleted by a concurrent launch's sweep. |
| `Dockerfile` | Image recipe (Debian 13 + Node + pnpm + claude CLI + baked orchestrator source). Built locally on first run, tagged `leerie:<VERSION>`. |
| `scripts/container-entry.sh` | Container PID 1. Runs as **root** (rootful runtimes) or the **rootlesskit-mapped host UID** (rootless containerd — see DESIGN §6 *Rootless exception*); the Dockerfile intentionally omits `USER leerie` so the entrypoint can set up cgroup containment before privilege drop. It resolves `CGROUP_ROOT` (the literal `/sys/fs/cgroup`, or — rootless — the systemd-delegated `user.slice/user-$HOST_UID.slice/user@$HOST_UID.service` subtree), creates `$CGROUP_ROOT/leerie.slice` and enables the memory+pids controllers (needed for the aggregate `memory.max` cap), then — the load-bearing step — launches the **cgroup broker** (`LEERIE_CGROUP_V2_ROOT="$CGROUP_ROOT" python3 /opt/leerie-image/scripts/cgroup-broker.py &`) at the same identity, before privilege drop, because worker cgroup enrollment and limit-setting cannot be done by the dropped-privilege orchestrator (see `scripts/cgroup-broker.py` below and DESIGN §6). `ulimit -c 0`, the cgroup slice setup, the broker launch, `cd /work`, `chown leerie: /work`, and `chown -R leerie: /tmp/.cache` all run at this pre-drop identity (the two `chown`s and the `runuser` drop itself are skipped in rootless mode). The `/tmp/.cache` chown is a runtime safety net for the same fix applied in the Dockerfile (after `useradd`, since the leerie user must exist): the build-time `mise install --system` creates `/tmp/.cache/mise/` as root (via `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache`), and on Fly Machines the rootfs preserves this ownership (unlike local nerdctl where `/tmp` is an ephemeral overlay), causing `mise install` to fail with EACCES when a repo pins a runtime version not pre-baked in the image. The final exec drops to leerie via `runuser -u leerie -- env HOME=/home/leerie USER=leerie LOGNAME=leerie ...`: if invoked with no argv (remote/Fly path — the launcher exec's the orchestrator via `flyctl ssh console -C "python3 -"` separately, which also drops via `Popen(user="leerie")`), the runuser exec wraps `sleep infinity` to keep the namespace alive; otherwise it wraps `python3 /opt/leerie-image/orchestrator/leerie.py "$@"` (local path — nerdctl always passes argv). The explicit `env` form is used instead of `runuser --login` because the login form would chdir to `/home/leerie` and override the `cd /work` invariant. |
| `scripts/cgroup-broker.py` | Cgroup broker (DESIGN §6 *Memory containment*). Launched by `container-entry.sh` at PID 1 before the privilege drop; the dropped-privilege orchestrator drives it over a Unix socket at `/run/leerie-cgroup.sock`. Handles `ping` / `probe` / `create <sid> <mem> <pids>` / `enroll <sid> <pid>` / `destroy <sid>` / `stat <sid>` (read-only → `OK <pids.current> <pids.max> <pids.events.max>`, used by `_cgroup_stat` for PID-exhaustion detection; DESIGN §6 *Detecting PID exhaustion*). Exists because worker cgroup enrollment and limit-setting cannot be done from the orchestrator's own dropped-privilege identity (a subtree merely `chown`ed after creation keeps its controller limit files root-owned, and cross-scope task migration needs write on the common-ancestor cgroup the leerie user doesn't own — both reproduced live). Detects and handles cgroup **v2** (unified `<V2_ROOT>/leerie.slice/leerie-w-<sid>/{pids,memory}.max` — `V2_ROOT` defaults to the literal `/sys/fs/cgroup` but is overridden via `LEERIE_CGROUP_V2_ROOT` to the systemd-delegated user slice under rootless containerd, DESIGN §6 *Rootless exception*) vs **v1/hybrid** (split `pids/`+`memory/` hierarchies at the fixed `V1_ROOT`, observed on Fly Firecracker VMs, never rootless). Validates every `<sid>` against `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` (no path traversal) and requires integer pids/limits — it is the single most-privileged surface, so it is kept minimal and auditable. |
| `scripts/remote/build-push.sh` | Build and push a self-contained leerie image to Fly.io's registry. The baked source at `/opt/leerie-image/` lets the image run on Fly Machines without any bind mount. Default mode is Fly's remote builder (no host Docker daemon required); the local-build path (nerdctl/docker on the host) is opt-in via `--local-build` or `LEERIE_LOCAL_BUILD=1`. The remote builder uses a tmp fly.toml with the `[build] image = ...` line stripped to avoid flyctl#1686 (where flyctl skips the build step in favor of fetching the pre-pinned image). |
| `scripts/remote/provision.sh` | Fly.io machine lifecycle helper (sourced by the `leerie` launcher's `RUNTIME=fly` branch). Exports `provision_machine()` (create → wait-started → register `decide_teardown` trap), `stop_machine()`, `destroy_machine()`, `_try_fetch_branch_for_teardown()`, and `decide_teardown()`. The trap fires on EXIT, INT, and TERM; `decide_teardown` classifies `$LEERIE_REMOTE_EXIT_RC` and routes to one of three dispositions: **sync-then-finalize-then-destroy** (genuine terminal exits: 0, EXIT_NEEDS_ANSWERS=10, EX_TEMPFAIL=75 — note: `EXIT_LOCKED=75` from the orchestrator is remapped to `container_rc=130` by the launcher's rc=75 branch before `LEERIE_REMOTE_EXIT_RC` is exported, so the only `rc=75` that *does* reach `decide_teardown` is genuine EX_TEMPFAIL from worker rate-limit / parse-fail surfaces, not the single-owner-per-run-dir refusal; see §Single-owner-per-run-dir enforcement below — `_try_fetch_branch_for_teardown` runs `fetch_branch` FIRST; on success, source `scripts/host-finalize.sh` and call `host_finalize <run-dir>` to push + open the PR with the host's auth; **only if push succeeds** does `destroy_machine` run; on push failure leave the machine RUNNING with a recovery banner pointing at `leerie --finalize <run-id> --runtime fly`; on sync failure same recovery pattern with `sync_failed_at` written to the sidecar), **detach** (host-side SIGINT=130/SIGTERM=143: user stopped watching, orchestrator on the machine is still running — leave machine alone, print reattach hints), or **pause-on-failure** (other non-zero rc: sync run state directory from machine to host via tar-pipe bounded by a 60 s timeout, then stop machine, write `paused_at`/`pause_reason` to the run sidecar; the state sync is best-effort — failure is logged but does not block the pause, and the machine-side state is preserved on the volume). With the tail wrapper now propagating the orchestrator's exit code via `orchestrator.exit_code`, `die()` exits (rc=1) reach the pause branch rather than the clean-exit branch, so partial-failure runs are paused (machine stopped, filesystem preserved) rather than destroyed. |
| `scripts/remote/lib.sh` | Shared bash helpers sourced by `provision.sh`, `resume-machine.sh`, `re-seed.sh`, `fetch-branch.sh`, `seed-repo.sh`. Exports `_extract_flyctl_remote_rc()` (parses the actual remote exit code from a captured `flyctl ssh console` stderr file — flyctl returns 1 for any non-zero remote exit; the real code is in stderr as `Error: ssh shell: Process exited with status <N>`; falls back to the original flyctl rc when the pattern is absent), `update_run_json()` (atomic merge of fields into `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<run-id>/run.json` on the host), `wait_for_started()` (poll `flyctl machine status` until the machine reaches `started`, with timeout), `require_flyctl()` (detect `flyctl` on PATH; if missing AND not `--no-runtime-install`, prompt to install via `brew install flyctl` on macOS or `curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh` on Linux; check `flyctl auth status` and prompt for `flyctl auth login` if unauthenticated), `render_tail_wrapper()` (emits a POSIX-sh wrapper script that tails `orchestrator.log` and watches orchestrator liveness via OR of pid-file `kill -0` and `/proc/[0-9]*/cmdline` scan for `orchestrator/leerie.py`+run-id — the cross-check closes the stale-pid contagion of DESIGN §6 *Single owner per run dir*; when the orchestrator exits, the wrapper reads `orchestrator.exit_code` from the run directory — written by `main()`'s `except SystemExit` handler before every controlled exit — and uses it as its own exit code so `decide_teardown` can route failed runs to the pause branch; when the file is absent (OOM, SIGKILL, crash before the handler ran), the wrapper falls back to exit 0 for backward compatibility), and `tail_with_optional_autofinalize()` (wraps `render_tail_wrapper` + `flyctl ssh console` with optional `AUTO_FINALIZE_TOKEN` plumbing: on clean exit, captures stderr through `tee`, greps for the token to extract the final run-id, then `exec`s `leerie --finalize <id>` on the host — used by both the fresh-launch tail and the `--resume` rc=75 pivot). Replaces four duplicated detection blocks across the remote scripts. |
| `scripts/remote/resume-machine.sh` | Resume helper for paused remote runs (sourced by the launcher's `RUNTIME=fly` branch — the run-id IS the machine ID, so no lookup is needed). Exports `resume_machine()`: compares the `image_tag` stored in the run sidecar against the current `$FLY_IMAGE_TAG` — if they differ (leerie was upgraded between provision and resume), runs `flyctl machine update --image $FLY_IMAGE_TAG --skip-start -y` to update the stopped machine's image before starting it (volumes at `/work` survive the update; `seed_auth` re-provisions the ephemeral rootfs on every resume); fail-open — if the update fails, logs a warning and proceeds with the old image. Then runs `flyctl machine start` (idempotent on already-running machines via the `flyctl machine status` fallback), waits for `started`, and clears `paused_at`/`pause_reason` from `run.json` if it exists. The launcher then runs the orchestrator inside the resumed machine with `--resume <id>`. When `image_tag` is absent from `run.json` (runs provisioned before the field existed), the update always fires (empty stored tag != current tag), ensuring legacy machines pick up the latest image on resume. |
| `scripts/remote/re-seed.sh` | Mid-run re-rsync helper (Phase 4). Exports `re_seed()`: reads `fly_machine_id` from the run sidecar, wakes the machine via `flyctl machine start` if stopped, runs a safety check that refuses re-seed when machine-side `/work` has uncommitted tracked changes (unless `LEERIE_RE_SEED_FORCE=1`), then calls `seed_repo_dirty` from `seed-repo.sh`. Invoked by the launcher's `--re-seed <run-id>` fast-path and by the auto-re-seed step in the `--resume <run-id> --runtime fly` flow. |
| `scripts/remote/seed-auth.sh` | Seeds Claude config + git identity into the provisioned Fly Machine. Tar-pipes the host's `$STAGE` (Keychain-extracted OAuth credentials + projects-stripped `~/.claude.json` + `.claude/` subdirs, with `.claude/local`, `.claude/plugins/cache`, and `.claude/plugins/marketplaces` skipped; `~/.aws/` also included when Bedrock mode is enabled — see `$STAGE/.aws` mount row above; `.gitconfig`, `.gitconfig.local`, `.gitignore`, `.gitignore_global`, `.git-credentials`, `.netrc`, `.ssh`, `.gnupg`, and `.config` are explicitly excluded from the tar — those are git/push auth that lives on the host per DESIGN §6 *Finalization* — ~408 MB host npm install duplicated by the Dockerfile's globally-installed claude binary, plus the bulky plugin cache that's rebuilt on the remote post-tar via `claude plugin marketplace add` + `claude plugin install` from the seeded `installed_plugins.json` / `known_marketplaces.json`) to `/home/leerie/` via `flyctl ssh console -C "tar -xzC /home/leerie"` (gzip on both ends). The tar pipe is wrapped with `$(_seed_timeout_prefix)` (`timeout --kill-after=5 ${LEERIE_SEED_TIMEOUT_S:-600}` on hosts that have GNU `timeout`; no-op fallback otherwise) so a stalled `flyctl ssh console` session — observed mode where flyctl never exits even though the remote tar made progress — produces a clean rc 124/137 instead of hanging forever. rc 124/137 triggers a one-shot `flyctl agent restart` retry; if the retry also stalls, the function returns 1 and leerie's existing PAUSED-on-failure path takes over (DESIGN §6 *Pause on failure*). A background heartbeat (`_seed_progress_bg`) logs "seed_auth: still streaming (Ns elapsed)" every `LEERIE_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_S` seconds (default 10) so the user sees activity rather than a silent multi-minute wait. Writes git identity to `/home/leerie/.gitconfig` (not `--global`, which would land in `/root/.gitconfig` under the ssh-console session's default root user). Pre-warms `claude --version` once as the leerie user so the orchestrator's preflight call hits warm caches (the FIRST claude invocation on a cold Fly machine takes ~17 s — Node + statsig cold start — and would otherwise exceed the orchestrator's preflight timeout). |
| `scripts/remote/seed-repo.sh` | Two-phase bundle + delta repo seeding helper (sourced by the `leerie` launcher after `provision_machine()` succeeds). Exports `seed_repo_clone` (wipe `/work` contents but preserve the inode; create `git bundle` for the parent and each submodule; pipe each bundle via `flyctl ssh console -C "sh -c 'cat > /tmp/...'"` — `sh -c` is required because bare `cat > ...` fails on flyctl's `-C`; have the machine `git clone` from the parent bundle, wire submodule URLs to their per-submodule bundles, run `git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule update --recursive` — `protocol.file.allow` is required by git 2.38+ for file://-style submodule URLs per CVE-2022-39253 — then chown to leerie; clean up the bundle tmpfiles), `seed_repo_dirty` (rsync the dirty/untracked delta plus force-included `.claude/`, used by both fresh-seed delta and the Phase 4 `re-seed.sh` flow), and the wrapper `seed_repo`. Bundles sidestep macOS BSD tar's NFC→NFD filename normalization, which corrupted submodule working trees containing non-ASCII filenames on the Linux receiver. No in-machine `git clone` from origin — Fly machines deliberately receive no GitHub credentials. The parent-bundle pipe is wrapped with `$(_seed_timeout_prefix)` (`timeout --kill-after=5 ${LEERIE_SEED_TIMEOUT_S:-600}` on hosts with GNU `timeout`; no-op fallback otherwise) and surrounded by a `_seed_progress_bg` background heartbeat; on rc 124/137 (timeout fired) the function returns 1 with a "flyctl ssh console likely stalled" diagnosis so leerie's PAUSED-on-failure path takes over (DESIGN §6 *Pause on failure*) matching the seed_auth pattern. A second `_seed_progress_bg` covers the submodule-bundle `git submodule foreach --recursive` batch so the user sees activity across multi-submodule transfers instead of a silent pause. **Shallow-seed path (heavy repos, DESIGN §6 *Shallow seeding for heavy repos*):** when the host repo's `.git` exceeds `LEERIE_SEED_SHALLOW_THRESHOLD_MB` (default `200`) AND the resolved seed depth is non-zero, `seed_repo_clone` skips the full `--all` bundle for the *parent* and instead: makes a throwaway `git clone --depth="$LEERIE_SEED_DEPTH" --no-local --branch <cur-branch> "file://$USER_REPO"`; `tar -cf -`s **only that clone's `.git`**; pipes the tar over the identical `$(_seed_timeout_prefix)`-wrapped `flyctl ssh console -C "sh -c 'cat > /tmp/leerie-seed-git.tar'"` channel (same heartbeat, same `PIPESTATUS[1]` + rc 124/137 handling); and the machine-side heredoc script (same pattern as `_seed_one_inspect_dir_clone`) empties `/work` inode-preservingly, untars `.git`, `git checkout -f`s the branch, `git remote remove origin` (the stale `file://<laptop>` origin is inert but removed defensively), runs the **unchanged** per-submodule bundle wiring, and `chown -R leerie: /work` last. Tarring `.git`-only (never the working tree) preserves the NFC→NFD safety property. `git bundle` cannot ship a shallow repo (grafted parents), which is why the shallow path uses tar rather than a shallow bundle. `LEERIE_SEED_DEPTH=0` (or a `.git` under threshold) keeps the full-bundle path. The shallow checkout yields a byte-identical tracked tree to the bundle clone, so `seed_repo_dirty` layers on unchanged. The shallow path additionally requires a shell-safe working-branch name (`_seed_branch_shallow_safe`: `^[A-Za-z0-9/._-]+$`, no placeholder tokens) because the branch is interpolated into the machine-side `git checkout -f <branch>` inside a `sh -c '…'` wrapper; a branch with `'`/`$`/backtick/space falls back to the full-bundle path (which never interpolates the branch). Detached HEAD likewise falls back. |
| `scripts/remote/fetch-branch.sh` | Post-run stream-back helper (sourced by `decide_teardown` BEFORE `destroy_machine` on clean exit, and by the `leerie --finalize` fast-path). Exports `fetch_branch()`: (1) discovers the completed run-id by scanning `.leerie/runs/*/run.json` on the machine for a `finished_at`-bearing, unpushed entry (stderr is captured to a tmpfile, NOT merged via `2>&1`, because `flyctl ssh console`'s "Connecting to ..." stderr would shift parsed-line indices and corrupt the discovered branch name); (2) probes whether the run branch actually exists on the machine via `git rev-parse --verify refs/heads/<branch>` — only then bundles; the bundle includes **all `leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/*` branches** present on the machine alongside the run branch (defense-in-depth: if integration never ran — crash, OOM, or `die()` before integration in older images — the raw subtask work is recoverable on the host; `git for-each-ref` discovers subtask branches dynamically; on any bundle failure the script retries with the run branch alone). A missing run branch is the cleared-but-empty terminal-state case (DESIGN §6); when the run branch is absent but subtask branches exist, they are bundled independently. The `no_push` flag on `run.json` is NOT used as a proxy because it's a mechanism flag the launcher forces (the in-Fly orchestrator can't push), not a user-intent flag; (3) tars `.leerie/runs/<run-id>/` from the machine and extracts it on the host; (4) **defense-in-depth, conditional on branch presence**: when a run branch *was* fetched, strips a stray mechanism-flag `no_push=true` from the host-side `run.json` (defense against in-flight old-image runs that wrote the mechanism flag before the `--host-no-push` intent split). When no branch was fetched (the cleared-but-empty terminal-state case — DESIGN §8), preserves `_finish_no_work_run`'s `no_push=true` intent so `host_finalize` short-circuits cleanly instead of attempting a `git push` against a non-existent ref; (5) **best-effort `.leerie/` stream-back**: iterates `config.toml` and `Dockerfile`; for each, skips if the host target already exists (never clobbers), checks remote existence via `_fetch_machine_exec test -f`, then streams via `_fetch_machine_exec cat` directly to the host target; failure removes any partial write and logs a warning but does not affect the function's return code. The destination root is `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` when set, otherwise `$USER_REPO/.leerie`. |
| `scripts/host-finalize.sh` | Host-side push + PR creation block, sourced by three call sites: the local-runtime post-run code path in `leerie`, `decide_teardown` in `scripts/remote/provision.sh` (Fly clean-exit auto-finalize), and the `leerie --finalize <run-id>` recovery fast-path. Exports `host_finalize <run-dir>`: honors `run.json.no_push` (skip — this is the **intent** flag, written by the orchestrator's `phase_finalize` from `push_will_happen(no_push, host_no_push)`, not the launcher-forced mechanism flag), short-circuits when `pushed_at` is already set **by branch position, not mere presence** (DESIGN §6 *Finalization*): compares the local run-branch tip against the pushed origin tip via `git rev-parse` / `git ls-remote` — equal tips → no-op (the idempotent common case, including fully-pushed chain waves); origin a strict ancestor of the local tip via `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, or origin absent (a prior finalize pushed a *partial* branch — e.g. a mid-wave `die()` stamped `finished_at` before the completion gate) → falls through to a fast-forward re-push + re-open PR, still behind the completion gate so only a `completed_waves == len(waves)` run can re-push (the gate itself fails open on a missing/unreadable `state.json`, so that check only applies when the signal exists); a *diverged* origin (has commits the local branch lacks) keeps the idempotent short-circuit instead, since its push could not fast-forward; on success keeps `pushed_at` set and sets `pr_url` (invariant `pr_url ⇒ pushed_at` preserved), **defense-in-depth**: when the run branch named in `run.json` does not exist locally (`git rev-parse --verify refs/heads/<branch>` fails — the cleared-but-empty terminal-state case where no `setup-run.sh` ran), logs "run branch absent locally; treating as no-op" and returns 0 rather than attempting a push that would error with `src refspec ... does not match any`, runs `git push -u origin <run-branch>` (with `--no-verify` if `NO_VERIFY_PUSH=true`). Before PR creation, validates that `working_branch` still exists on origin via `git ls-remote --exit-code --heads`; if deleted (common when a stacked run's parent was squash-merged while this run was in flight), falls back to the repo's default branch. Then `gh pr create` (using `pr_title`/`pr_body` from `run.json` if the pr_writer worker populated them, otherwise the deterministic fallback), wrapped in a bounded retry (`0 5 10 20 30`s backoff, ~68 s total) to ride out GitHub's post-push ref-indexing lag ("No commits between" / "Head sha can't be blank"). PR-creation failure is non-fatal (push already succeeded); the error message suggests a retry command using the resolved base (original or fallback). Replaces ~140 lines of inline launcher code with a single function call so the three callers stay in sync. |

### Python runtime — provisioned inside the container

Leerie requires Python 3.10+. The container image installs Debian 13's
`python3` (currently 3.13), which satisfies the requirement. The host
needs no Python at all. The orchestrator's source is baked into the
image at `/opt/leerie-image/` via the Dockerfile's `COPY` instructions.
On local runs the launcher's bind mount (`-v $LEERIE_REPO:/opt/leerie-image:ro`)
shadows the baked copy, so iterating on `orchestrator/leerie.py` still
does not require an image rebuild — the host file is used on the next run.

The orchestrator prefers stdlib. Third-party runtime libraries are
permitted when they (a) replace non-trivial logic with a widely-used,
stable implementation, (b) earn their distribution cost (image size,
build time, dependency tracking), and (c) are documented here. Pins
live in `requirements.txt` at the repo root; the Dockerfile runs
`pip3 install --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`
once per image build. There is no `pyproject.toml` and no PyPI release.

Current runtime deps:

- `tenacity` — exponential backoff for transient `claude -p` envelope
  errors (auth / rate-limit). See §3 *Auth/quota backoff*.
- `tree-sitter` — incremental parser core, required by the P6 repo-map
  (`build_repo_map`). Deliberate exception to the stdlib-preferred
  policy: tree-sitter's mtime-cached symbol/reference graph is the
  structural foundation that prevents shallow planner splits
  (DESIGN §5½ *P6 — codebase structural map*). Ships a
  prebuilt manylinux wheel; no C build needed.
- `tree-sitter-language-pack` — prebuilt grammar collection (Python,
  TypeScript, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Rust, …) for `tree-sitter`. Paired
  with the `tree-sitter` pin; the `cp310-abi3` ABI tag means one wheel
  covers Python 3.10 through 3.13 (the container's Debian 13 Python).

`pytest` remains the sole dev dependency, run on the host against the
bind-mounted source.

### Path A — Claude Code plugin marketplace (primary)

```
/plugin marketplace add enricai/leerie
/plugin install leerie@enricai-leerie
# then inside Claude Code:
/leerie "task description"
```

`marketplace.json` exposes one plugin (the existing `plugin.json`).
Claude Code clones the repo into its plugin directory and registers the
`commands/` and `skills/` entries. `/leerie` then runs the plugin
skill at `commands/leerie.md`, which shells out to the on-disk
`leerie` launcher in the cloned plugin directory — and through it,
to `nerdctl run`. See §0.5 for the launcher's per-mode (terminal vs
plugin) TTY adaptation.

### Path B — `curl | bash` installer (secondary)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enricai/leerie/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The script:

1. **Preflight**: verifies `git`, `claude`, and `curl` are on `PATH`.
   Missing deps print a platform-specific remediation hint and the
   script exits non-zero.
2. **Runtime preflight**: per `uname -s`. On macOS: verifies `colima`
   is installed and the VM is running. On Linux: verifies `nerdctl`
   is installed and reaches containerd. Prints copy-pasteable install
   hints on failure (`brew install colima` / distro package commands).
   Does NOT auto-install brew/apt packages — that's the user's choice.
3. **Clones** `enricai/leerie` to `$LEERIE_HOME` (default `~/.leerie`).
   `git clone --depth 1` for fresh installs; `git pull --ff-only` for
   upgrades.
4. **Symlinks** `$LEERIE_HOME/leerie` → `~/.local/bin/leerie`. Creates
   `~/.local/bin` if missing. Does not touch system directories.
5. **PATH check**: if `~/.local/bin` is not in `$PATH`, prints (does
   not silently edit) the exact shell-rc line to add, based on `$SHELL`.
6. **Verifies** by invoking `leerie --version` (the launcher's fast path
   answers without spinning up a container — see below).

Supports `--dry-run` (prints actions without executing) and
`--prefix DIR` (overrides `LEERIE_HOME`).

### `--version`

`leerie --version` reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `version`
field — single source of truth. Two parallel readers:

- **Orchestrator** (`_read_version()` in `leerie.py`): stdlib `json` load.
  Exercised by `tests/test_version_flag.py`.
- **Launcher** (bash `awk` extraction): used by the fast path that
  short-circuits container startup. Both readers return the same value
  on the same `plugin.json`, and `tests/test_version_flag.py` guards
  the canonical surface.

`install.sh` uses `leerie --version` as its end-to-end smoke test — and
because the fast path doesn't require a running container, the smoke
test runs the moment the symlink is in place.

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §2 (no plugin-spawned subagents — the launcher is
plain process exec, not in-session orchestration). §6 *Worker subtree
termination* and §0.5 of this document describe what runs inside the
container the launcher starts.

---

### `config`

Launcher bash case arm: `config)`. `leerie config` is a host-only fast
path — it exits before `nerdctl run` and never starts a container. It is
listed alongside `--version` in the ownership-guard skip-list so it never
claims a state directory. Four sub-modes:

- **bare (`leerie config`)**: prints effective build/lint/test config for
  `$USER_REPO` with `[config]` / `[inference]` provenance per axis (reads
  `.leerie/config.toml` if present, otherwise infers). Also prints any
  non-comment `key = value` lines from `leerie.toml` when that file exists.
- **`leerie config --init`**: creates `.leerie/` and writes
  `.leerie/config.toml` with auto-detected BLT values (uncommented) and a
  commented `setup_packages` example. Refuses with exit 1 if `config.toml`
  already exists. Prints the path and suggests `git add .leerie/`.
- **`leerie config --chat`**: execs interactive `claude` (NOT `claude -p`)
  with `--system-prompt-file $LEERIE_REPO/prompts/config_chat.md` and
  `--add-dir $USER_REPO`. No container started. Exits 1 if
  `prompts/config_chat.md` is missing.
- **`leerie config --recapture [--force]`**: host-only (no container). Calls
  `run_recapture_deps()` from the orchestrator module, which consolidates
  across **all** finished runs with `logs/` under the state dir (not just the
  newest — each run's commands inform the dep decision). With an explicit
  `--run-id`, only that run is targeted. Without `--force`, runs that already
  have a `dep_capture.done` sentinel are skipped and the write is a never-clobber
  **union** (only new packages/managers added). `--force` drops the sentinel on
  each target run so the worker re-fires unconditionally **and** switches the
  write to a wholesale **replace** (`capture_repo_deps(replace=True)`) — the
  fresh capture is authoritative and deps no longer captured are dropped; an
  empty capture leaves the existing config untouched. Each run's `State` is
  flocked (skipped, not fatal, on
  `StateLockedError`). Exits 1 if no runs directory or no finished run found.
  The seam `exec_module()`s `orchestrator/leerie.py` on the **host**, whose
  `python3` is not guaranteed to have `requirements.txt` deps (§0), so the
  orchestrator's sole third-party import (`tenacity`) is deferred into
  `claude_p()` rather than module scope — the run-discovery guards above are
  pure pathlib checks and print their diagnostic even when `tenacity` is absent.

All four sub-modes share an inline BLT inferrer (`_config_read_key`,
`_infer_axis`, `_axis_source`) implemented directly in the launcher bash
so the verb requires no container and no orchestrator import. `_infer_axis`
mirrors `_infer_build_lint_test()`'s precedence and family coverage
(§4 *Phase walkthrough*, below) by hand, since the verb cannot import the
orchestrator. `tests/test_config_verb.py`'s per-mode unit tests still run
against a self-contained bash harness (kept in sync with `_infer_axis` by
hand) for speed and isolation, but a separate parity guard in that file
extracts the real `config)` case arm verbatim from the shipped launcher
and diffs its inference output against `_infer_build_lint_test()` across
a fixture matrix, so the launcher inferrer can no longer silently diverge
from the Python table.

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §6½ *Declared BLT commands* (the `.leerie/config.toml`
format and resolution); §6½ *Per-repo container image* (`setup_packages`,
`prompts/config_chat.md` for the interactive session).

---

## 0.5. Container shape

Leerie runs entirely inside a single container per run (DESIGN §6 *Worker
subtree termination*). The orchestrator is PID 1 in the container;
every `claude -p` worker it spawns is a child process in the same PID
namespace; every Bash tool call those workers make lands in the same
namespace too. When PID 1 exits, the kernel reaps the namespace —
which is the abnormal-exit cleanup guarantee.

### Runtime requirements per OS

| OS | Container engine | CLI | VM? |
|----|------------------|-----|-----|
| macOS (arm64 or x86_64) | containerd inside a Colima-managed Linux VM | `nerdctl` host-side shim (`colima nerdctl install`) | Yes — managed by Colima |
| Linux (any distro with containerd) | containerd native | `nerdctl` from distro or upstream | No |

The launcher detects `uname -s` and runs the right preflight. On macOS:
require `colima` on `PATH`, check `colima status`, auto-install the
`nerdctl` shim if missing (via `colima nerdctl install`), then check
`nerdctl info` reaches the runtime. On Linux: require `nerdctl` on
`PATH` and `nerdctl info` succeeds. Both paths print a copy-pasteable
install hint on failure and exit non-zero — leerie does not invoke
`brew`, `apt`, `dnf`, or `pacman` itself.

`brew install nerdctl` does NOT work on macOS — the Homebrew formula
has `Requires: Linux` because the nerdctl binary talks directly to a
containerd Unix socket. Colima's `colima nerdctl install` is the
supported macOS path; it drops a host-side shim on `$PATH` that
proxies every invocation to nerdctl inside the VM.

### Image build

`Dockerfile` at the repo root. Built locally on first run
(`nerdctl image inspect "$IMAGE_TAG"` miss → `nerdctl build`).
`IMAGE_TAG=leerie:<VERSION>` so a leerie upgrade triggers a fresh build
once and reuses the layer cache thereafter. ~60–120s first build,
subsequent runs < 3s.

Base layers (top-down):

- `debian:13-slim` — minimal, predictable, glibc-based.
- `apt-get install`: `ca-certificates`, `curl`, `git`, `openssh-client`,
  `python3`, `python3-pip`, `build-essential`, plus dev libraries
  (`zlib1g-dev`, `libyaml-dev`, `libreadline-dev`, `libffi-dev`,
  `libssl-dev`, `libpq-dev`, `libsqlite3-dev`, `libgdbm-dev`,
  `default-libmysqlclient-dev`). The build tools and
  dev headers cover native-extension compilation: `node-gyp` (sharp,
  bcrypt), Ruby C gems (`nokogiri`, `pg`, `sqlite3`, `mysql2`, `ffi`), and
  Python C extensions.
- `libc6` + `chromium` + `chromium-driver` + `fonts-liberation` — headless
  Chrome for browser-based testing (Selenium, Capybara, Playwright, Puppeteer,
  or any tool that drives a real browser). Installed from Debian's own repos at
  image build time so the browser and chromedriver versions are always in sync;
  Selenium Manager has nothing to download at runtime.
  `libc6` is listed explicitly so apt upgrades it in the same transaction as
  chromium: the `debian:13-slim` base image snapshot can lag the current trixie
  glibc, causing chromium to fail at load time with
  `undefined symbol: localtime64_r (fatal)` — a glibc ABI mismatch that
  produces a SIGTRAP before Chrome executes a single instruction.
  `/home/leerie/.cache/selenium` is pre-created and chowned to `leerie` so
  Selenium Manager cache writes don't fail even if a download is attempted.
  Workers run as the non-root `leerie` user — Chrome's SUID sandbox won't work
  in this container configuration; the required flags are baked in via
  `/etc/chromium.d/leerie-container-flags` (see *Browser-based testing* note
  below).
- Node.js LTS, arch-aware via `TARGETARCH` / `dpkg --print-architecture`
  → `arm64` → `linux-arm64` tarball, `amd64` → `linux-x64`. Pinned via
  `ARG NODE_VERSION` so the version is reproducible across builds.
- `pnpm` (pinned), `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (the
  `claude` CLI workers invoke; leerie enforces ≥ 2.1.22 at runtime).
- Non-root `leerie` user created with `--build-arg HOST_UID/HOST_GID`
  matching the host user. This is what makes files the container
  writes into `/work` (worktrees) and `/leerie-state` (run state) keep
  the host user's ownership.
- `git config --system --add safe.directory '*'` is set in the image
  (writes to `/etc/gitconfig`). The container is single-tenant (one
  user) and `/work` is its only repo, so blanket-allow is the standard
  mitigation — Colima/virtiofs presents `/work`'s mount-root inode with
  a gid that does not match the in-container `leerie` user, which trips
  git's CVE-2022-24765 check on worker bash tools that run
  `git -C <worktree-subdir> ...`. Without the relaxation, those calls
  return non-zero with
  `fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/work/.leerie/...'`.
  System-wide config (vs. per-user `--global`) avoids any HOME-handling
  risk from `su leerie -c "git config --global"` and matches the posture
  of every major CI image.
- `WORKDIR /work`, `ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/leerie-image/scripts/container-entry.sh"]`.
  **No `USER leerie` directive** — ENTRYPOINT runs as PID 1 at the
  slice-owning identity (real root rootful; the rootlesskit-mapped host
  UID rootless) so the entrypoint can create the
  `/sys/fs/cgroup/leerie.slice` cgroup and launch the **cgroup broker**
  (which performs per-worker enrollment/limit-setting the dropped-privilege
  orchestrator cannot) before dropping privilege via
  `runuser -u leerie -- ...` to invoke the orchestrator (the `runuser`
  drop is skipped in rootless mode — DESIGN §6 *Rootless exception*).
  See DESIGN §6 *Memory containment* for the full mechanism.

### Per-repo derived image (local nerdctl)

After the base image is confirmed present, the launcher checks for a
`.leerie/Dockerfile` in the user's repo (or auto-generates one from
`setup_packages` — see DESIGN §6½ *Per-repo container image*). The
relevant bash surface:

| Function / variable | Location in `leerie` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `_leerie_sha256 <file>` | after base-build block | Portable sha256 of a file — uses `sha256sum` (Linux) or `shasum -a 256` (macOS) |
| `_leerie_repo_id` | after base-build block | Sanitized repo identifier from `git remote get-url origin` (or `basename $USER_REPO` fallback); lowercase, `[a-z0-9._-]` only, `/` → `-` |
| `resolve_repo_image_tag()` | after base-build block | Returns `leerie-repo/<repo-id>:<LEERIE_VERSION>` when a Dockerfile is present (real or to-be-auto-generated), empty string otherwise |
| `ensure_base_in_buildkit_ns` | after base-build block | Copies the base `$IMAGE_TAG` into the `buildkit` containerd namespace via `nerdctl save \| nerdctl --namespace buildkit load`, so BuildKit (whose containerd worker is bound to the `buildkit` namespace, not `default`) can resolve the derived `FROM $BASE_IMAGE` locally instead of falling back to the registry (a never-pushed tag 401s). Idempotent: skips when `nerdctl --namespace buildkit image inspect "$IMAGE_TAG"` already succeeds. Best-effort/non-fatal (logs a warning on failure). Called before both the language-dep probe build and `build_repo_image`. |
| `build_repo_image <tag>` | after base-build block | Runs `nerdctl build --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=<IMAGE_TAG> --build-arg HOST_UID/GID -t <tag> -f .leerie/Dockerfile <USER_REPO>`; exits 1 on failure. Runs in the `default` namespace (no `--namespace`), so the derived image lands where `nerdctl run`/`image inspect` read it; `ensure_base_in_buildkit_ns` must have run first. |
| `REPO_IMAGE_TAG` | after base-build block | Set to `resolve_repo_image_tag()` output when a Dockerfile exists; empty string otherwise |
| `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/.dockerfile-hash` | after base-build block | Stores `<LEERIE_VERSION>:<sha256>` of the last-built Dockerfile; rebuild fires on mismatch or image absence |

**Rebuild triggers** (checked in order): (1) `nerdctl image inspect "$REPO_IMAGE_TAG"` fails, OR (2) `<LEERIE_VERSION>:<sha256>` of the current Dockerfile differs from the stored hash. Second run with unchanged Dockerfile hits the skip path ("per-repo image up-to-date; skipping build"). Before the build fires, `ensure_base_in_buildkit_ns` copies the base into the `buildkit` namespace (idempotent) so the derived `FROM $BASE_IMAGE` resolves against the local image store rather than the registry.

**Auto-generation from `setup_packages`**: when `.leerie/config.toml` declares `setup_packages` and no `.leerie/Dockerfile` exists, the launcher generates an apt-install Dockerfile at `.leerie/Dockerfile` (atomic write via temp file + `mv`) before the build-decision block. A committed Dockerfile always takes precedence — `setup_packages` is ignored when both exist.

**`nerdctl run` image arg**: `"${REPO_IMAGE_TAG:-$IMAGE_TAG}"` — falls back to the base image transparently when no repo Dockerfile is present.

### Registry publish path (fly.io / remote Machines)

Fly.io Machines pull an image from a registry rather than using a
locally-built image. The `HOST_UID/HOST_GID` coupling exists only for
local bind-mounts (so files written by the container into `/work` keep
the host user's ownership). Remote Machines have no such bind-mount, so
the Dockerfile's defaults (`ARG HOST_UID=501 / HOST_GID=20`) are used
as-is — no UID matching required.

**Baked source.** The Dockerfile's `COPY` instructions bake
`orchestrator/`, `scripts/`, `prompts/`, and `.claude-plugin/` into the
image at `/opt/leerie-image/`. A Fly Machine that pulls this image can
run the orchestrator without any bind mount — the ENTRYPOINT
(`/opt/leerie-image/scripts/container-entry.sh`) and the orchestrator
(`/opt/leerie-image/orchestrator/leerie.py`) are already present. On
local runs the launcher's `-v $LEERIE_REPO:/opt/leerie-image:ro` bind
mount shadows the baked copy, so development iteration (edit a file,
run leerie) still works without rebuilding the image.

`scripts/remote/build-push.sh` provides the build-and-push path. By
default it uses Fly's remote builder (no host Docker daemon required):

```bash
# Default: Fly's remote builder builds + pushes (recommended):
./scripts/remote/build-push.sh --app <fly-app-name> --push

# Verify the baked source works inside a Machine:
flyctl machine run registry.fly.io/<fly-app-name>:<VERSION> \
  --app <fly-app-name> \
  -- python3 /opt/leerie-image/orchestrator/leerie.py --version
```

Internally, the remote-builder path runs:

```bash
flyctl deploy --build-only --push --remote-only \
  --app <fly-app-name> \
  --config <tmp-fly.toml> \
  --dockerfile <DOCKERFILE> \
  [--build-arg KEY=VAL ...] \
  --image-label <VERSION>
```

`<DOCKERFILE>` defaults to `$LEERIE_REPO/Dockerfile`; pass `--dockerfile
<path>` to override (used by `ensure_image()` for per-repo images). Pass
`--build-arg KEY=VAL` one or more times to forward build arguments to
flyctl; this flag is repeatable and accumulated before forwarding.

The `<tmp-fly.toml>` is a copy of the repo's `fly.toml` with the
`[build] image = "..."` line stripped. That line is correct for
`flyctl machine run` (leerie uses it elsewhere) but wrong for
`flyctl deploy --build-only`: it tells flyctl "the image already
exists, fetch it" → flyctl skips the build step → deploy fails with
"Could not find image" ([flyctl#1686](https://github.com/superfly/flyctl/issues/1686)).
The awk-based strip works around it.

**Opt-in: `--local-build`** (or `LEERIE_LOCAL_BUILD=1`). Builds with
host `nerdctl`/`docker` and pushes from the host. Requires a working
Docker daemon authenticated to `registry.fly.io`. Does NOT work with
nerdctl-in-Colima on macOS — nerdctl reads `~/.docker/config.json`
but cannot resolve `credsStore: desktop` (no access to macOS
Keychain from inside the Lima VM). Documented in INSTALL.md for
completeness; most users should leave it off.

#### Auto-publish on first remote run (`ensure_image()` in the launcher)

A remote run requires the image at `$FLY_IMAGE_TAG` to already exist in
`registry.fly.io`. Without auto-publish the operator must run
`scripts/remote/build-push.sh --push` once before the first remote run,
and again after every version bump — otherwise `flyctl machine run`
fails at provision time with an unfriendly "manifest unknown" error.

The launcher closes that gap with `ensure_image()` in the `RUNTIME=fly`
branch, run before `provision_machine`. Two variants:

**Base image path** (no `.leerie/Dockerfile`):

1. Cache check: if `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/leerie/published-tags.txt` already
   has `$FLY_IMAGE_TAG`, skip everything.
2. Auto-create the Fly app if it doesn't exist. `flyctl apps list
   --json` is parsed for a name match; on miss, `flyctl apps create
   $LEERIE_FLY_APP` is invoked. Idempotent — "already exists" is a
   silent success.
3. Invoke `scripts/remote/build-push.sh --app $LEERIE_FLY_APP --push`.
   `--local-build` is forwarded if `LOCAL_BUILD=true` (set by the
   `--local-build` CLI flag or `LEERIE_LOCAL_BUILD=1` env var).
   build-push.sh handles the actual remote-vs-local mode dispatch.
4. On success, append the tag to the positive cache.

**Per-repo derived image path** (`.leerie/Dockerfile` present):

The relevant bash surface:

| Function / variable | Location in `leerie` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `_set_fly_per_repo_image()` | before `resolve_fly_image_tag()` call in the `RUNTIME=fly` block | Detects `.leerie/Dockerfile`, computes tag, sets `LEERIE_FLY_IMAGE` + context vars; no-op when absent |
| `_FLY_PER_REPO_DOCKERFILE` | module-level (set by `_set_fly_per_repo_image`) | Absolute path to `.leerie/Dockerfile`; empty string when no per-repo Dockerfile |
| `_FLY_BASE_TAG` | module-level (set by `_set_fly_per_repo_image`) | Base Fly tag (`registry.fly.io/$APP:$VERSION`) passed as `BASE_IMAGE` build-arg |

Before `resolve_fly_image_tag()` is called, `_set_fly_per_repo_image()`
detects `.leerie/Dockerfile`, computes a 12-character hex hash of its
content, and sets `LEERIE_FLY_IMAGE=registry.fly.io/$APP:$VERSION-$HASH`.
`resolve_fly_image_tag()` returns that value (via the existing
`LEERIE_FLY_IMAGE` override hook). `ensure_image()` then:

1. Cache check on the per-repo tag — skip if already in
   `published-tags.txt`.
2. Ensure the base image is published: check the cache for the base tag
   (`registry.fly.io/$APP:$VERSION`); on miss, invoke build-push.sh for
   the base image first and cache the result.
3. Build and push the per-repo image: invoke build-push.sh with
   `--dockerfile $USER_REPO/.leerie/Dockerfile --build-arg
   BASE_IMAGE=registry.fly.io/$APP:$VERSION --tag <per-repo-tag>`.
4. Append the per-repo tag to the positive cache.

The per-repo tag format is `registry.fly.io/$APP:$VERSION-$HASH` where
`$HASH` is the first 12 hex characters of `sha256($LEERIE_DOCKERFILE)`.
A rebuild fires automatically when the Dockerfile content or the leerie
version changes — the hash changes, a cache miss occurs, and
ensure_image re-runs build-push.sh.

Results are cached at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/leerie/published-tags.txt` (default
`~/.cache/leerie/published-tags.txt`), one line per `<tag>` known to be
present. Cache hits skip the probe entirely; cache misses fall through
to the probe and on success append the tag. The cache is a *positive*
list only — a missing entry means "probe", not "absent" — so manual
`flyctl image` deletions are self-healing on the next run.

Flags:

| Flag | Env | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--no-auto-publish` | `LEERIE_NO_AUTO_PUBLISH=1` | off | Skip the probe entirely; trust the operator to have published the image. The run still proceeds; if the tag is missing, `provision_machine` fails as before. |

The flag is consumed by the launcher and not forwarded to the
orchestrator (same convention as `--no-runtime-install`).

Note the key paths inside the container:

- **`/leerie-state/`** is the run-state directory (state.json, logs,
  worktrees, telemetry). It lives on the host filesystem via the
  `/leerie-state` bind mount (`LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR`) and persists
  across container runs. In *local mode*, worktrees land under
  `/leerie-state/runs/<run-id>/worktrees/` — outside `/work`.
- **`/opt/leerie-image/`** is the orchestrator source tree. On local
  runs it is a read-only bind mount of `$LEERIE_HOME` on the host; on
  Fly Machines it is the baked copy from the Dockerfile's `COPY`
  instructions. Both paths resolve identically at runtime — the
  ENTRYPOINT and orchestrator code always live at
  `/opt/leerie-image/{scripts,orchestrator}/`.

The container's PID 1 (the entry script) reads from `.leerie-image/`
and writes to `/leerie-state/` (the state bind mount). Confusing the
two would either break runs (writing to the read-only mount) or
corrupt the install (writing to the source tree).

### Entrypoint and source mounting

`scripts/container-entry.sh` is exec'd as PID 1, running as **root**
(the Dockerfile intentionally omits `USER leerie` — see DESIGN §6
*Memory containment* for why root at PID 1 is required to launch the
cgroup broker). Sketch of the relevant final exec:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
ulimit -c 0
# … CGROUP_ROOT resolution: /sys/fs/cgroup (rootful), or the
# systemd-delegated user slice (rootless — see below) …
# … cgroup slice setup: mkdir + enable controllers on
# $CGROUP_ROOT/leerie.slice …
# Launch the cgroup broker before the privilege drop (worker cgroup
# enrollment/limit-setting can't be done by the dropped-privilege
# orchestrator), telling it which root to operate under:
LEERIE_CGROUP_V2_ROOT="$CGROUP_ROOT" python3 /opt/leerie-image/scripts/cgroup-broker.py &
cd /work
# … /work ownership fix (Fly volume-attach path) …
# … /tmp/.cache ownership fix (Fly rootfs preserves root-owned mise cache) …
exec runuser -u leerie -- \
  env HOME=/home/leerie USER=leerie LOGNAME=leerie \
  python3 /opt/leerie-image/orchestrator/leerie.py "$@"
```

**Rootless containerd.** Under rootless containerd (Linux), rootlesskit
maps the host UID to container UID 0. The entrypoint detects this by
checking `/proc/self/uid_map` (non-zero host-start field on the first
line → `ROOTLESS=true`) and, when true, also extracts `HOST_UID` (that
line's second field — the real host UID rootlesskit mapped container UID
0 to). When rootless:

- The `chown leerie: /work` and `runuser -u leerie --` steps are
  skipped — container "root" IS the host user, so privilege drop would
  break bind-mount access and chown would reassign to the subuid range.
- `CGROUP_ROOT` is anchored at
  `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$HOST_UID.slice/user@$HOST_UID.service`
  instead of the top-level `/sys/fs/cgroup` — the mapped host UID has no
  privilege over the true top level (root-owned, mode 0555), but systemd
  already delegates this subtree to that UID's login session. Any cgroup
  the UID creates underneath it (via `mkdir`) inherits that UID's
  ownership on every auto-created interface file, including `pids.max` /
  `memory.max` — unlike a directory merely `chown`ed after creation. This
  is passed to `cgroup-broker.py` via `LEERIE_CGROUP_V2_ROOT` (its
  `V2_ROOT`, default `/sys/fs/cgroup` when unset — every non-rootless
  case); the v1/hybrid split-hierarchy path (`V1_ROOT`, Fly-only) is
  never overridden. The broker itself needs no separate privileged
  identity here: it's launched at the same rootlesskit-mapped identity
  the whole container runs as, which is exactly what `CGROUP_ROOT` is
  delegated to. Cross-scope worker-PID migration into `leerie.slice`
  still works because cgroup v2 only requires write access to the
  destination and the nearest common ancestor (not the source), and that
  ancestor — `user@$HOST_UID.service` — is what's delegated. See DESIGN
  §6 *Rootless exception* for the full mechanism.
- On hosts where this delegation doesn't hold (non-systemd rootless init,
  or a systemd host that doesn't delegate `pids`/`memory` into the
  per-session slice), the slice-setup writes (`|| true`) and the broker's
  write-then-read-back check in `_detect()` both fail silently — same as
  any other containment-incapable host — and the fail-closed containment
  gate stops the run unless the operator passes
  `--dangerously-allow-uncapped`.
- On macOS (Darwin), the launcher unconditionally sets the `rshared`
  bind-mount — Colima's VM always runs rootful containerd with cgroup
  v2 and shared propagation, but the host has no `/sys/fs/cgroup` to
  probe. On native rootful Linux the launcher adds the same `rshared`
  mount unconditionally. Rootless containerd is its own branch, gated on
  the `containerd-rootless/child_pid` sentinel, and uses a **plain**
  bind-mount with no `bind-propagation` flag: rootlesskit's
  `--propagation=rslave` demotes `/sys/fs/cgroup` to a slave mount, which
  is incompatible with `bind-propagation=rshared`. Only read/write
  visibility into the already-mounted cgroupfs is needed here — not
  propagation of new mount events — so the plain bind-mount is
  sufficient. When cgroup v2 isn't present at all, the mount is skipped,
  the broker probe fails, and the fail-closed gate
  (`enforce_and_record_cgroup_containment`) stops the run unless
  `--dangerously-allow-uncapped` is set.

**User-namespace remap.** Claude Code rejects
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` from UID 0. The rootless entrypoint
uses `unshare --user --map-user --map-group` to remap outer UID 0 to
the `leerie` user in a nested user namespace, so the orchestrator runs
as non-root and the flag is accepted. The OCI default seccomp profile
blocks `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`, so the launcher passes
`--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` for rootless runs (gated on
`containerd-rootless/child_pid`). See DESIGN.md §6.

The orchestrator's source lives at `/opt/leerie-image/`. It is present
in two ways depending on execution mode:

- **Local runs:** the launcher bind-mounts `$LEERIE_HOME` read-only at
  `/opt/leerie-image`. Iterating on `orchestrator/leerie.py` does not
  need an image rebuild — the bind mount shadows the baked copy and
  the host file is picked up on the next `leerie` invocation.
- **Fly.io Machines (remote):** there is no bind mount. The Dockerfile
  `COPY` instructions bake `orchestrator/`, `scripts/`, `prompts/`,
  and `.claude-plugin/` into the image at `/opt/leerie-image/` so the
  entrypoint resolves without any host-side path. A new leerie version
  requires rebuilding and pushing the image (see §0.5 "Registry publish
  path").

### Bind-mount table

The launcher passes the following mounts to `nerdctl run`:

| Host path | Container path | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$(pwd -P)` (user repo) | `/work` | rw | The repo leerie operates on. Git worktrees live here. Writes flow back to the host so `--resume` works across container runs. Run state (`.leerie/`) is mounted separately via `/leerie-state` (see below). |
| `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` (resolved host state dir) | `/leerie-state` | rw | *Local mode only.* Leerie run state (state.json, runs/, logs/, worktrees/). Mounted at a top-level container path distinct from `/work` so the repo checkout stays pristine — no `.leerie/` dir accumulates inside the project. The orchestrator reads the container path from `LEERIE_STATE_DIR=/leerie-state` (passed as `-e` in the same `nerdctl run` invocation). `LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` is resolved on the host by the launcher before launch; see §2 "Host-side per-repo state directory". |
| `$LEERIE_HOME` (leerie install dir) | `/opt/leerie-image` | ro | *Local mode only.* Orchestrator source + Dockerfile + prompts. Read-only because the container has no business mutating the install. Shadows the baked COPY layer so edits to `orchestrator/leerie.py` take effect without an image rebuild. Absent in registry / fly.io mode — the baked COPY layer is used directly. |
| `$STAGE/.claude.json` (per-run host scratch) | `/home/leerie/.claude.json` | rw | Per-container copy of `~/.claude.json` with the `projects[]` block stripped. The host file is never directly mounted into a container: the shared mount is a documented `claude-code` corruption race (anthropics/claude-code issues #28847, #29217, #29395, #40226 — all open) that hangs workers in a recovery loop with no backoff. Each container writes only its private copy. |
| `$STAGE/.claude` (per-run host scratch) | `/home/leerie/.claude` | rw | Per-container copy of `~/.claude/` with bulky, prior-session, and history paths skipped (`history.jsonl`, `projects/`, `sessions/`, `tasks/`, `plans/`, `todos/`, `file-history/`, `paste-cache/`, `shell-snapshots/`, `session-env/`, `telemetry/`, `stats-cache.json`, `debug/`, `downloads/`, `backups/`, `chrome/`, `ralph-state/`, `.last-cleanup`, `settings.json.*`, `plugins/cache/`, `plugins/marketplaces/`). CLI capability dirs (`agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `plugins/installed_plugins.json` + sibling JSON, `mcp-needs-auth-cache.json`, `settings.json`, `local/`, `statsig/`, `cache/`, `package.json`, `policy-limits.json`) ride along. `plugins/cache/` and `plugins/marketplaces/` are rebuilt on the remote in the fly runtime; see `scripts/remote/seed-auth.sh` step 4 (`# --- 4. Rebuild plugin cache`). |
| `_extract_claude_credentials_json` → `$STAGE/.claude/.credentials.json` | `/home/leerie/.claude/.credentials.json` | rw | The launcher's `_extract_claude_credentials_json` helper resolves "where do Claude OAuth credentials live on this host" via a single fallback chain — Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`, via `security find-generic-password -w`, macOS only), then `$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json` on disk, then `$CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` synthesized into the same JSON shape — and writes it to the staged path with mode 600. The Linux CLI reads exactly that path, so both platforms use the same file-based auth flow inside the container. Single source of truth: the same helper is called from the `--chain` arm to populate `LEERIE_WORKER_ENV_JSON`'s `LEERIE_CLAUDE_CREDS_B64` key (base64-encoded), so chain workers receive identical credentials without a separate Keychain probe. |
| `$STAGE/.gitconfig`, `.gitconfig.local`, `.gitignore`, `.gitignore_global`, `.git-credentials`, `.netrc` (per-run host scratch) | `/home/leerie/.<same>` | rw | Per-container copies of each present host `~/.git*` sibling and `~/.netrc`. Worker can `git config --local` / mutate freely without affecting host state. |
| `$STAGE/.config/git` (per-run host scratch) | `/home/leerie/.config/git` | rw | XDG-style git config (`~/.config/git/config`, `~/.config/git/ignore`) copied per-container. |
| `$STAGE/.ssh` (per-run host scratch) | `/home/leerie/.ssh` | rw | Per-container copy of `~/.ssh/` with `agent/`, `S.*`, and `*.sock` excluded — host UNIX sockets aren't reachable from inside the container and `cp -a` on them is pointless. Keys and `known_hosts` ride along so workers can SSH-push if needed. Permissions set to `0700`. |
| `$STAGE/.gnupg` (per-run host scratch) | `/home/leerie/.gnupg` | rw | Per-container copy of `~/.gnupg/` with agent socket files (`S.gpg-agent*`, `S.scdaemon`, `S.keyboxd`) excluded and `use-keyboxd` stripped from `common.conf` (the container cannot reach the host keyboxd daemon; stripping the directive makes gpg fall back to file-based `pubring.kbx` lookup — on keyboxd-only hosts signing keys become unfindable, which is acceptable since commit signing is best-effort). Keyrings + `trustdb.gpg` ride along so workers can `git commit -S` if signing is configured. Permissions set to `0700`. |
| `$STAGE/.aws` (per-run host scratch, **Bedrock mode only**) | `/home/leerie/.aws` | **ro** | Staged when `detect_bedrock_mode()` finds `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` set to a truthy value (`1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`, case-insensitive — matching Claude CLI's `isEnvTruthy`) in the `env` block of any of the three settings files the Claude CLI merges (`~/.claude/settings.json` (userSettings), `<USER_REPO>/.claude/settings.json` (projectSettings), `<USER_REPO>/.claude/settings.local.json` (localSettings)). The Claude CLI's AWS SDK resolves credentials via pure file I/O — reads `~/.aws/config` (profile + SSO session config) and `~/.aws/sso/cache/*.json` (SSO access tokens, ~12 h TTL) directly; no `aws` binary is needed inside the container. `~/.aws/cli/cache` is excluded (CLI result cache; large, irrelevant to auth). Mounted **read-only** because workers never write credentials. The `aws` binary (`awsAuthRefresh`) is a host-only concern: `aws sso login` requires an interactive TTY/browser and cannot run inside a non-interactive container; `bedrock_preflight()` catches an expired SSO token on the host before the container starts and prints the recovery hint (`aws sso login --profile <profile>`). On the Fly.io path, `$STAGE/.aws/` is included in the tar pipe to `seed_auth` automatically (`.aws` is not in the seed-auth exclude list) and lands at `/home/leerie/.aws/` on the remote machine. Belt-and-suspenders: when Bedrock mode is active, the launcher also injects `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`, `AWS_PROFILE`, and `AWS_REGION` as explicit env vars — via `AUTH_MOUNTS` `-e` flags on the local nerdctl path and via `child_env` in the Fly detached-launch heredoc — so workers activate Bedrock through `process.env` independently of how the in-container claude binary handles `settings.json` env blocks. |

The four host-auth mounts (`~/.config/gh`, `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.ssh`,
`$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) that earlier versions of leerie bind-mounted **no longer
exist** — finalize moved to the host (DESIGN §6 *Finalization*), so
`git push` and `gh pr create` run with the host's working auth state and
don't need to be forwarded into the container. The macOS-only "SSH agent
forwarding is not available" note is gone for the same reason.
| `~/.cache/leerie/mise-data` | `/home/leerie/.local/share/mise` | rw | Mise's `MISE_DATA_DIR` (per-repo runtime installs, plugins, cache). Lives in the user dir so the resolver checks it first then falls through to the image-baked `MISE_SYSTEM_DATA_DIR=/usr/local/share/mise` for the LTS fallback (DESIGN §6½). |
| `~/.cache/leerie/pnpm-store` | `/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/pnpm-store` | rw | pnpm content-addressable store. Pointed at via `npm_config_store_dir` (the pnpm-respected env var; `PNPM_STORE_PATH` doesn't exist and would be silently ignored). Safe for concurrent installs across worktrees (pnpm/discussions#10702). |
| `~/.cache/leerie/pip` | `/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/pip` | rw | pip HTTP + wheels cache. Each worker that needs Python deps runs `pip install` / `uv sync` itself in its own worktree against this shared cache; after the first install of a package the cache is warm and subsequent workers' installs are fast. Wheel-build race pypa/pip#9034 is still a theoretical concern but in practice rare given leerie's small worker concurrency (DESIGN §6½). |
| `~/.cache/leerie/go-mod` | `/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/go-mod` | rw | `GOMODCACHE`. Concurrent-safe via per-module-version `flock` in `cmd/go/internal/modfetch`. |
| `~/.cache/leerie/cargo` | `/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/cargo` | rw | Whole `CARGO_HOME` (registry + bin + config.lock). Mounting only `registry/` breaks `config.lock` (cargo#11376). Concurrent-safe via cargo's documented flock semantics. |
| `~/.cache/leerie/corepack` | `/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/corepack` | rw | `COREPACK_HOME`. Without this, corepack inherits `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache` and tries to mkdir `/tmp/.cache/node/corepack/v1`, which fails under rootless UID remapping. Concurrent-safe: corepack downloads tarballs via atomic rename; the cache is read-mostly after first install. |
| `~/.cache/leerie/bundle` | `/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/bundle` | rw | `BUNDLE_PATH` for Bundler (Ruby gems). `BUNDLE_CACHE_ALL=1` instructs Bundler to cache all gems (including git-sourced ones) so each `bundle install` reuses downloaded gems across worktrees and runs. |
| Each `--inspect-dir` path (translated) | `/inspect/<basename>` | ro | See below. |

### `LEERIE_*` env-var forwarding (local `nerdctl run`)

The orchestrator runs **inside** the container and reads every override from
`os.environ` — which only inherits what `nerdctl run` forwards. The launcher
forwards **every `LEERIE_*` var in its environment except a deny-list** of
launcher/host-only vars (the `_leerie_env_denylist` array in the `nerdctl run`
block). A `for` loop over `compgen -v | grep '^LEERIE_'` appends a bare
`-e "$name"` (host value passed through) for each non-deny-listed var with a
non-empty value. Empty/unset vars are skipped.

Deny-list = forward-all-minus-known-host-only, not an allow-list, so the
dynamic per-worker names (`LEERIE_MODEL_<WORKER>`, `LEERIE_EFFORT_<WORKER>`,
built at runtime from `f"{MODEL_ENV}_{worker.upper()}"`) forward automatically
and a future override cannot silently be stranded at the container boundary.
Deny-listed vars are the launcher/host-only ones: `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` and
`LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS` (remapped separately to container-internal values —
`-e LEERIE_STATE_DIR=/leerie-state`, `-e LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS=`), `LEERIE_HOME`
/ `LEERIE_REPO` / `LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` / `LEERIE_SELF_CMD` (self-location +
host paths), `LEERIE_NO_PUSH` (orchestrator always gets `--no-push`; host does
the push), `LEERIE_RUNTIME` (decided launcher-side before launch), and the
Fly/remote/chain/wave machinery. `tests/test_launcher_env_forwarding.py`
extracts the loop verbatim and includes a coupling guard asserting no
orchestrator-read override is deny-listed except four justified exceptions
(`LEERIE_STATE_DIR`, `LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS`, `LEERIE_NO_PUSH`, `LEERIE_RUNTIME`).
On the Fly path the equivalent forwarding is via `child_env` in the
detached-launch heredoc, not this loop.

### `--inspect-dir` path translation

Inspect dirs (`--add-dir` forwarded to `claude -p` for cross-repo
context) come from CLI flags, the `LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS` env var, or
`leerie.toml`'s `inspect_dirs` key. They are *host* paths. The launcher:

1. Collects all three sources before any container is started.
2. For each host path: resolves it on the host (`cd -P "$path" && pwd`,
   so symlinks and `~` are expanded), bind-mounts it read-only at
   `/inspect/<basename>` inside the container, and rewrites the
   corresponding CLI flag to point at the in-container path.
3. Passes only the rewritten flags into the container, and clears
   `LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS` in the container env so the in-container
   resolver doesn't see any host paths.

This honors the orchestrator's precedence rules in `resolve_inspect_dirs`
(CLI > env > TOML) by emitting only CLI args — the env and TOML pre-passes
in the launcher synthesize CLI flags.

A host path *inside* `$USER_REPO` (already visible at `/work/<subpath>`)
collides with the launcher's `/inspect/<basename>` target. The launcher
warns and skips the redundant mount.

#### Remote runtime (Fly.io) transport

Under `--runtime fly`, the launcher additionally ships each
`--inspect-dir` host path to `/inspect/<basename>` on the Fly machine
via `scripts/remote/seed-repo.sh:seed_inspect_dirs`. The rewritten
`--inspect-dir /inspect/<basename>` CLI flag already carries the
in-machine view to the orchestrator via `REWRITTEN_ARGS`; this step
makes the path actually exist on the machine's filesystem.

Per inspect dir, transport is two-phase, mirroring the
`seed_repo_clone` + `seed_repo_dirty` strategy used for `/work`:

- **Git repos** — `git bundle create - --all` packs every reachable
  object into one pack-format binary stream, piped via
  `flyctl ssh console -C "sh -c 'cat > /tmp/leerie-inspect-<base>.bundle'"`.
  Submodules are bundled the same way into
  `/tmp/leerie-inspect-<base>-subs/`. The machine then `git clone`s
  from the local bundle file into `/inspect/<base>` (with
  `protocol.file.allow=always` for the submodule update;
  CVE-2022-39253 mitigation). A second pass (`_seed_one_inspect_dir_dirty`)
  rsyncs the uncommitted-edit delta on top via `fly_rsync_wrapper` so
  workers see your in-flight changes for inspect dirs, the same way
  they do for the main repo.
- **Non-git directories** (docs folders, etc.) — fall back to plain
  `rsync -a -H` via `fly_rsync_wrapper` (the v1 path; kept for the
  no-`.git/` case).

Why bundle for git repos: plain rsync over `flyctl ssh console` is
unworkable for non-trivial trees. Empirically (2026-06-02), a
~1.7 GB / 120k-file working tree (`~/src/enric/stackpulse` with
`node_modules`, `.next`, `.pnpm-store`) hung indefinitely under v1's
plain rsync. The same repo's bundle is ~600 KB and ships in one pipe
in under a second. Gitignored build artifacts stay on the host; the
inspect-bucket workers only need source.

Resume probe: before the bundle phase, `seed_inspect_dirs` runs one
`flyctl ssh console -C "test -d /inspect/<base>/.git"` per inspect
dir. If the directory was already seeded on a prior run, the bundle
is skipped and only the dirty delta refreshes — typical resume cost
is a few seconds per inspect dir, not a few minutes. New inspect
dirs added at `--resume` time take the full fresh path.

Each `/inspect/<basename>` is chowned `leerie:leerie` after every
transport phase so the orchestrator (which runs as `leerie`) and
its workers can read the tree — same ownership-handover pattern
`seed_repo_clone` / `seed_repo_dirty` use for `/work`.

The launcher serializes its `INSPECT_HOST_TARGETS` bash array (parallel
to `INSPECT_MOUNTS`, populated by `collect_inspect_path` for every
out-of-repo inspect dir) into the `LEERIE_INSPECT_HOST_TARGETS` env var
before each call. In-repo inspect dirs (the skip-redundant-mount branch)
are not appended to `INSPECT_HOST_TARGETS` — they arrive on the machine
via `seed_repo` at `/work/<subpath>` and need no separate transport.

Called at two points inside the `--runtime fly` block:

1. **Fresh provision** — after `seed_repo` lands `/work`, before the
   detached orchestrator launches.
2. **Resume / re-seed** — after `re_seed` lands the dirty delta, on
   every resume. This honors the documented property that inspect
   dirs are re-resolved fresh on every run including `--resume`
   (§2 *Inspect directories*); the user can add `--inspect-dir <path>`
   at resume time and expect it to land on the machine.

A failure of `seed_inspect_dirs` is fatal — the run aborts before the
orchestrator launches, in the same class as `seed_repo` / `seed_auth`
failures. Workers cannot do their job with `--add-dir` flags pointing
at non-existent paths, so silent continuation would yield wrong
classifier / planner output.

Read-only contract: inspect-bucket workers only `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`
inspect dirs (DESIGN §12). No rsync `--delete` or two-way sync is
used.

Inspect dirs are **not** `git clone`d *from origin* on the machine
because the machine deliberately holds no GitHub credentials (DESIGN §6
*Finalization*). The bundle approach above ships the host's local git
state directly — no remote auth ever needed in-machine.

Same rsync-vs-tar rationale as `seed_repo_dirty` (applies to the
fallback path and the dirty-delta phase): macOS BSD `tar -c`
normalizes filenames NFC → NFD (libarchive); rsync preserves filename
bytes verbatim. Bundles sidestep the problem entirely — filenames
travel as pack-format binary objects, materialized natively by the
receiving git.

### Browser-based testing

Chromium and its matching chromedriver are baked into the image (see *Image
build* above), so workers that need a real browser have one available without
any runtime installation. The Selenium cache directory
(`/home/leerie/.cache/selenium`) is pre-created and chowned to `leerie` so
Selenium Manager cache writes succeed if it ever runs.

**Container flags — baked in, no project changes required.** Three flags are
needed to run Chromium in a rootless container:

- `--no-sandbox` — disables Chrome's user-namespace sandbox, which is
  unavailable in unprivileged containers.
- `--disable-setuid-sandbox` — suppresses the SUID sandbox-helper lookup.
  Without this, Chrome finds `/usr/lib/chromium/chrome-sandbox` and tries to
  exec it; SUID is stripped in rootless containers, so the exec fails and
  Chrome crashes with `SIGTRAP` before fully initializing — *even when
  `--no-sandbox` is present*. This is the most common silent failure mode.
- `--disable-dev-shm-usage` — redirects shared-memory to `/tmp`; `/dev/shm`
  is typically 64 MB in containers and Chrome's renderer can exceed it.

These are written to `/etc/chromium.d/leerie-container-flags` at image build
time, so the `/usr/bin/chromium` wrapper picks them up automatically on every
invocation. **No project-level Chrome flag configuration is required** — the
image handles it.

Projects that construct a `ChromeOptions` / `Options` object and add these
flags explicitly are fine; the flags are idempotent. Projects that don't touch
Chrome options at all also work, because the wrapper sets them globally.

### macOS-specific: Colima auto-share scope

Colima auto-shares only paths under `/Users/$USER` into the VM by
default. A bind mount of a path outside that range will silently
appear empty inside the container. The launcher warns at preflight
when `$USER_REPO` or any `--inspect-dir` falls outside, and points
the user at `~/.colima/default/colima.yaml`'s `mounts:` section as
the workaround.

VirtioFS is the mount type leerie documents (`colima start
--runtime containerd --mount-type virtiofs`) — it's the fastest
option and gives correct UID semantics for bind mounts.

### Logging, signal flow, and TTY adaptation

The launcher invokes `nerdctl run --rm $TTY_FLAGS …` where `TTY_FLAGS`
is chosen by a one-line `[ -t 0 ]` test:

```sh
TTY_FLAGS="-i"
[ -t 0 ] && TTY_FLAGS="-it"
```

That single test is **the entire branch** between terminal mode and
plugin mode. Everything else (mounts, image, env, entrypoint, signal
handling) is identical.

**Terminal mode (`-it`)**:

- `-i` + `-t` give the orchestrator a controlling TTY → its existing
  `log(...)` and stream-event summarizers write directly to the user's
  terminal with no aggregation layer.
- `--clarify` prompts use `input()` interactively — the user types
  answers at the host terminal, characters flow through the pty to
  Python inside the container.
- Ctrl-C in the host terminal sends SIGINT to the container's PID 1
  (the orchestrator). Python's `KeyboardInterrupt` fires, the
  existing `except KeyboardInterrupt` handler runs the worktree-only
  cleanup, the orchestrator exits — and the kernel reaps everything
  else in the PID namespace.

**Plugin mode (`-i` only)**:

- Claude Code's Bash tool spawns the launcher without a TTY on stdin.
  `[ -t 0 ]` returns false; the launcher passes only `-i`, no pty
  allocated inside the container.
- Inside the container, `sys.stdin.isatty()` returns False. The
  orchestrator's `gather_answers()` and the mid-execution
  clarification path (`surface_clarification()`) both detect this and trigger
  the canonical no-TTY signal: write `<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/pending-questions.json`
  to disk and `sys.exit(EXIT_NEEDS_ANSWERS)` (= 10).
- `<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/pending-questions.json` is visible on the
  host because `/leerie-state` is bind-mounted from `LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR`.
  The plugin agent at `commands/leerie.md` reads it directly, asks the
  user via the chat UI, writes the matching `<state-root>/answers.json`,
  and re-runs the container with `--answers <state-root>/answers.json`
  and `--resume`.
- Stdout/stderr stream back through the Bash tool to the agent's
  chat session — possibly in 30s-ish chunks per the harness's
  buffering, which is acceptable for the streaming UX.
- The kernel teardown guarantee applies the same way as in terminal
  mode: when the orchestrator exits (clean exit, exit 10, or any
  signal the harness sends), PID 1 dies and the namespace is reaped.

Common to both modes:

- `--rm` removes the stopped container automatically so they don't
  accumulate. Worktrees and state on the bind-mounted host
  filesystem survive for `--resume`.
- `--name leerie-<ts>-<pid>` makes `nerdctl ps` legible and
  `nerdctl logs <name>` targetable for the rare diagnostic case.
- `--label leerie.launcher_pid=<pid>` records the owning launcher's
  PID (`$$`) on the container. The stale-container reaper (below) reads
  it back via `nerdctl inspect` to test owner liveness without parsing
  the `--name` suffix. `<pid>` is the same `$$` used in `--name`.
- Aggregate memory cap: **not a `nerdctl run` flag.** `container-entry.sh`
  (PID 1) writes `leerie.slice/memory.max` (the parent cgroup of every
  per-worker cgroup), derived from VM `MemTotal` read from
  `/proc/meminfo` (portable across Colima and native Linux; the host
  launcher cannot read the VM's MemTotal on macOS, so a `nerdctl
  --memory` flag is not used). This bounds the sum across all concurrent
  workers, distinct from the per-worker cgroup caps in §6 (*Memory
  containment*) which bound each worker individually. See DESIGN §6
  *container boundary's hidden precondition* and the caps table in §6.

**Abnormal-exit cleanup (traps + reaper).** The container boundary
guarantees namespace teardown *when PID 1 exits*, but a host CLI that
dies without forwarding a stop signal (OOM-killed `nerdctl` client,
uncatchable SIGKILL) leaves the container orphaned and holding the
run-dir flock — every later `--resume` then exits `EXIT_LOCKED=75`
(DESIGN §6). Two launcher mechanisms close this:

- **Kill-on-exit trap.** INT/TERM traps on the local run path
  `nerdctl kill` the container (via its run-id, which equals the
  container ID — see *Single-owner enforcement*) before the launcher
  exits, and the EXIT trap performs the same kill *before* it removes
  the cidfile. Reliable for Ctrl-C/SIGTERM; does NOT help under
  SIGKILL/OOM (uncatchable) — that is the reaper's job.
- **Stale-container reaper.** On the local `--resume` path, before the
  `nerdctl run` spawn, the launcher looks up any container whose ID
  equals the resume run-id (`nerdctl inspect`), and if it is still
  running but its owning launcher (`leerie.launcher_pid` label) is dead
  (`kill -0` fails), `nerdctl kill`s it first — making `--resume`
  self-heal the orphaned-flock wedge instead of returning 75.
- **Decoupled output streaming (piped mode only).** In piped mode
  (`leerie … | tee log`, i.e. `TTY_FLAGS="-i"` and stdout is not a TTY),
  the launcher does NOT let `nerdctl run` write straight to its stdout
  pipe. Colima's persistent SSH ControlMaster forwards the run's stdout
  and holds a copy of the launcher's pipe write-end; on an abnormal
  container exit it retains that copy, so `tee` never gets EOF and the
  launcher hangs (orphaning the container). Instead the launcher points
  `nerdctl run > "$_run_log" 2>&1` (a regular file — the mux does not
  retain a plain-file fd) and starts `tail -n +1 -f "$_run_log"` in the
  background, streaming the file to its own stdout. `_reap_tail` (called
  after the run and from all three EXIT/INT/TERM traps) briefly sleeps so
  `tail` drains the final write, then `kill`s it and `rm`s the log — no
  post-kill `cat`, which would duplicate the whole log. The `nerdctl`
  argv is assembled once into a `_run_argv` array and invoked in two
  spelled-out branches (redirected vs. direct) because bash cannot build
  a redirection through variable expansion. Container exit-code capture
  (`|| container_rc=$?`) is unaffected — `> file` is not a pipe.
  Interactive `-it` runs skip the decouple entirely (real pty, no `tee`,
  no hang, stdin needed for `--clarify`). See DESIGN §6 *Launcher hang on
  abnormal container exit*.

The plugin mode flow above is exactly what `commands/leerie.md` already
documents — it works through the container with zero new mechanism
because the state dir lives on the bind-mounted `/leerie-state` host filesystem.

### What does NOT change in the orchestrator

`orchestrator/leerie.py` is unmodified by this design. It runs as PID 1
inside the container; everything it currently does — the asyncio
event loop, the signal handlers, `claude -p` spawn via
`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`, the per-worker `_terminate_proc_tree`
and `_DescendantTracker` (kept as the fast happy path for clean exits
— see DESIGN §6), worktree management, telemetry — works unchanged.
Container/process isolation is the launcher's concern, not the
orchestrator's.

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §6 *Cleanup on abnormal exit / Worker subtree
termination*.

## 2. Installation and usage

```bash
# From the root of the target git repository:
leerie "Fix the login timeout bug and add a regression test"

# Or pass a path to a .txt / .md file whose contents are the task — useful
# for multi-paragraph briefs that are awkward to quote on the shell:
leerie path/to/task.md

# Resume an interrupted run. Auto-picks if exactly one in-flight run exists;
# pass the run-id otherwise (see `leerie --list`).
leerie --resume
leerie --resume bugfix-login-timeout-bug-b81e90

# Route to remote execution (e.g. Fly.io) instead of local nerdctl run:
leerie "task" --runtime fly
export LEERIE_RUNTIME=fly
# Or commit to leerie.toml for a per-repo default:

# Skip pre-push hooks at finalize (the user's explicit override; defaults off).
# Affects only the final `git push`; worker `git commit` operations inside
# worktrees continue to run all hooks normally.

# Opt into clarification (DESIGN §11). Without --clarify (the default),
# the classifier's intent questions are filtered and dropped — the
# implementer makes a best-effort decision documented in its notes.
# Pass --clarify to surface the surviving questions to the user
# (interactively if a TTY, otherwise via pending-questions.json).

```

Requirements: the `claude` CLI on `PATH` and logged in interactively (no API
key — subscription auth); `git`; a git repository with `user.email` and
`user.name` configured; a container runtime (colima on macOS, nerdctl +
containerd on Linux — see `docs/INSTALL.md`). Python is provisioned inside
the container by the image (Debian 13's `python3` 3.13); the host does not
need Python. The launcher's `--version` fast path returns without starting
a container.

Via the plugin skill, from inside Claude Code (after
`/plugin marketplace add enricai/leerie` and
`/plugin install leerie@enricai-leerie` — see §0):

```
/leerie <task>
```

### Source-of-truth preference

For feature work, leerie needs to know whether to draw conventions from the
codebase, from online research, or from both (codebase first; research as
fallback). Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--source-of-truth`** CLI flag, values `codebase` | `research` | `both`.
   Argparse rejects anything else before the orchestrator runs.

2. **`LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH`** environment variable, same value set.

3. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root** (committed, so the preference travels
   with the repo). Plain `key=value` syntax:

   ```
   source_of_truth = codebase
   ```

4. **Default `both`.** When unset, leerie runs feature tasks with
   `source_of_truth = both` — codebase patterns first, with researched
   best-practice standards as a fallback where the codebase is insufficient.
   The preference is never surfaced as an interactive question; setting it
   explicitly (CLI, env, or file) overrides the default.

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()` — bad
config is caught before any worker spawns.

> The CLI/env > file order reflects that the CLI flag and env var are
> session-scoped knobs (a user reaching for them is making a one-off
> override), while `leerie.toml` is the committed default for the repo.

### Clarification preference

By default leerie runs without surfacing intent questions to the user
(DESIGN §11). The classifier still runs the codebase→research filter and
the implementer still applies it before any mid-execution decision —
"no questions" never means "skip the rigor." Pass `--clarify` to opt
into surfacing the surviving questions. Resolution order (highest
priority first):

1. **`--clarify`** CLI flag (action=`store_true`).
2. **`LEERIE_CLARIFY`** environment variable (boolean, parsed by
   `_parse_bool_envtoml`: 1/0, true/false, yes/no, on/off).
3. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root** with `clarify = true`.
4. **Default `False`.** No questions are surfaced; the implementer
   makes a best-effort decision and documents it in
   `investigation_notes`.

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()` —
same shape as `--source-of-truth` resolution.

### Permission override (dangerous)

By default, judgment workers (classifier, planner, reconciler,
plan_overlap_judge, provision) run in the real repo cwd with a narrow
Bash allowlist (`INSPECT_TOOLS`) and **without**
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
This mechanically prevents them from mutating state — the §12
enforcement that a planner cannot run `pnpm run typecheck`,
`tsc --noEmit`, or any other side-effecting subprocess. Acting workers
(implementer, conformer, integrator) run in isolated worktrees with
the broader `ACT_TOOLS` allowlist and the skip-permissions flag —
their blast radius is bounded by the worktree.

`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is the escape hatch. When set, every
`claude -p` invocation — including judgment workers in the real repo
cwd — is invoked with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. This waives
the §12 mechanical read-only enforcement on judgment workers and
shifts trust onto their prompts. Use it on repositories where the
planner needs to observe build/test tooling that the narrow inspect
allowlist excludes — Node/TS repos where the planner reflexively
reaches for `pnpm`/`tsc`/`biome`/`vitest`/`npx` and currently
~18-19% of its Bash calls fail with "requires approval" in headless
mode. See DESIGN §12 and §15 *Known limitations* (the "unattended
execution requires broad write permission" paragraph) for the
guarantee being waived.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--dangerously-skip-permissions`** CLI flag (action=`store_true`).
2. **`LEERIE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS`** environment variable
   (boolean, parsed by `_parse_bool_envtoml`: 1/0, true/false, yes/no,
   on/off).
3. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root** with
   `dangerously_skip_permissions = true`.
4. **Default `False`.** Judgment workers stay narrow-allowlisted; the
   §12 mechanical enforcement holds.

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()` —
same shape as `--no-push` resolution. When the flag is active, leerie
emits a visible startup log line so every run shows the escape hatch
is engaged.

### Containment override (dangerous)

Worker cgroup containment (DESIGN §6 *Memory containment*) is enforced by
a cgroup broker (`scripts/cgroup-broker.py`) running at the slice-owning
identity; the dropped-privilege orchestrator can neither enroll workers
nor set their limits itself. Just before the first worker
spawns (in `_run_phases`, past the resume short-circuits so zero-worker
completed/no-work resumes are not gated), `enforce_and_record_cgroup_containment`
probes the broker end-to-end and records `{enforced, hierarchy}` in
`state.json` (the `cgroup_containment` field). If containment cannot be enabled — broker
down, no usable cgroup hierarchy (neither a cgroup-v2 unified mount nor
v1 pids+memory controller mounts), or read-only cgroupfs — leerie
`die()`s by default, because a silently-uncapped run is what let a
runaway subtree exhaust the VM thread/PID table (a Bun `EAGAIN` crash).

`--dangerously-allow-uncapped` is the escape hatch: it downgrades the
fatal gate to a loud warning and runs workers without memory/PID limits.
Resolution order (same shape as `--dangerously-skip-permissions`):

1. **`--dangerously-allow-uncapped`** CLI flag (action=`store_true`).
2. **`LEERIE_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_UNCAPPED`** environment variable.
3. **`leerie.toml`** with `dangerously_allow_uncapped = true`.
4. **Default `False`.** Containment is required; the run stops if it
   cannot be enforced.

### Budget feasibility preflight

`max_total_workers` (DESIGN §13 *Budget feasibility — fail fast at
the cheapest moment*) is enforced two ways. The cheap, late check is
`State.bump_workers()`, which raises `WorkerError` the moment the
counter would exceed the cap mid-execution. The complementary *early*
check is `check_budget_feasibility()`, called once in `_run_phases()`
immediately after `schedule()` returns its `(subtasks, waves)` pair
and before `write_plan()` persists anything. It estimates the
remaining `claude -p` calls the run will consume:

```
estimated_remaining = (
    len(subtasks) * caps["subtask_call_estimate"]   # impl + ~conformer per subtask
    + len(waves)                                     # one integrator per wave
    + caps["conformance_rounds"]                     # final-tree conformance pass
    + 1                                              # pr_writer (finalize itself is shell)
)
total_estimate = st.data["worker_count"] + estimated_remaining
if total_estimate * caps["budget_safety_margin"] > caps["max_total_workers"]:
    die(... recommended --max-workers ..., code=EXIT_BUDGET_INFEASIBLE)
```

The estimate adds to `worker_count` (which already reflects every
upstream phase: classifier, provision, planners, reconciler, overlap
judge), so the only free variable is the per-subtask multiplier.
Calibration corpus (six runs on disk as of 2026-06-03; three completed
runs cluster at 2.0–2.31 calls/subtask, summarizer's lint-fighting
inflator pushed it to 2.59 — see prompts/{implementer,conformer}.md
§"Environmental issues are out of scope"). Default `2.5` is honest:
covers the worst observed real ratio, and the explicit `1.15` safety
multiplier on top means the guaranteed headroom against the cap is
~1.44×.

Resolution order for the opt-out (highest priority first):

1. **`--skip-budget-check`** CLI flag (action=`store_true`).
2. **`LEERIE_SKIP_BUDGET_CHECK`** environment variable
   (`_parse_bool_envtoml`).
3. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root** with `skip_budget_check = true`.
4. **Default `False`.** The check runs.

Skipped on `--resume`: the resume path enters `_run_phases` past
`schedule()` (the `waves` field is loaded from `state.json`), so the
preflight has nothing to gate. A run that died on the preflight is
not resumable — `--resume` would re-fire the same check with the same
inputs and die identically. The user re-runs with the recommended
`--max-workers` value or splits the task.

Exit code `EXIT_BUDGET_INFEASIBLE = 11` on `die()`, distinct from
`EXIT_NEEDS_ANSWERS = 10` (deferred-clarification structured exit)
and the generic `die()` error code 1. The Fly runtime's `decide_teardown`
trap (`scripts/remote/provision.sh`) routes `11` through the same
case-arm as `0|10|75` (genuine terminal exits): the trap calls
`_try_fetch_branch_for_teardown` to pull whatever state landed on
the machine back to the host, then takes the `_run_finished_at == ""`
fallback (the run never reached finalize, so no `host_finalize` is
attempted) and `destroy_machine` runs cleanly. A code-11-specific
recovery hint is printed: "re-run with the recommended --max-workers
value" — distinct from the code-10 hint which suggests `--finalize`,
because a budget-infeasible run has no work to finalize and `--resume`
would die at the resume guard (no `waves` field in `state.json`).
This routing keeps the user from paying for a Fly volume indefinitely
on a structurally-unrecoverable run.

### Single-owner-per-run-dir enforcement

DESIGN §6 *Single owner per run dir*. The orchestrator refuses to
start a second instance against a run directory that another
orchestrator already owns. Two code-surface elements implement this:

- `EXIT_LOCKED = 75` constant in `orchestrator/leerie.py`. Emitted
  via `sys.exit(EXIT_LOCKED)` (not `die()`) so the prefix is not
  `leerie: error:` — same shape as `EXIT_NEEDS_ANSWERS`'s
  structured non-error exit, since refused-resume is a routing
  signal, not an error. Caller-side handlers print a
  `leerie --resume <run-id>` hint via `log()` before exiting (the
  launcher's smart-router will then attach to the live stream
  rather than spawn a duplicate).
- `StateLockedError` exception in `orchestrator/leerie.py`. Raised
  by `State.__init__` when `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on the
  run-directory fd fails with `BlockingIOError`. The exception
  carries `run_dir` so callers can include the path in the user
  message. Raised with `from None` to suppress the
  `BlockingIOError.__context__` chain in the traceback.

The lock primitive itself:

- `State.__init__(leerie_root, run_id, repo_root=None)` opens
  `self.run_dir` with `os.open(..., O_RDONLY)`, stores the fd on
  `self._lock_fd`, and acquires `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`. The
  fd is held for the life of the State instance. The optional
  `repo_root: Path | None` parameter defaults to `leerie_root.parent`
  when not provided — needed because `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` can place
  `leerie_root` outside the repo, making `leerie_root.parent`
  incorrect as a repo root.
- `State.release_lock()` closes the fd. Idempotent. Used by tests;
  the production path relies on the kernel's process-exit cleanup.
- `State.__del__` is defensive (calls `release_lock` only if
  `_lock_fd` was set — `__init__` can raise before that field
  exists). Best-effort; the kernel guarantees release on process
  exit regardless.
- `State.save` is unchanged in body. The flock is on the run
  directory inode, not the state.json inode, so the
  `tmp.replace(self.path)` swap inside `save()` does not affect the
  lock. Docstring updated to make this explicit.
Two checked construction sites that catch `StateLockedError`:

- `main()` at the `State(leerie_root, run_id, repo_root=repo_root)` call:
  logs the message + `sys.exit(EXIT_LOCKED)`.
- `--phase judge|heal` at the `phase_st = State(...)` call: same
  pattern, since `--phase` mutates state and would race the same
  way `--resume` would.

The launcher heredoc (`leerie:2679-2696`) takes a fast-path flock
probe on `run_dir` before invoking the orchestrator subprocess. On
`BlockingIOError` the probe exits 75. The probe is advisory — the
orchestrator's `State.__init__` flock acquire is the load-bearing
enforcement that catches any path bypassing the launcher (manual
`python3 leerie.py --resume`, future verbs, debugging).

Host-side rc=75 branch (`leerie:~3563`) sets `container_rc=130`
(not 1, not 75). decide_teardown's classifier treats `rc=130|143` as
detach-banner (leave the machine running, print reattach hints) —
exactly the right disposition when the original orchestrator is
still alive. Setting `container_rc=1` or 75 would route into
sync-then-finalize-then-destroy or pause-on-failure, both of which
would tear down the original orchestrator's machine.

**flyctl exit-code workaround.** `flyctl ssh console` does not forward
the remote process's exit code — it returns 1 for any non-zero remote
exit. The actual code appears only in stderr
(`Error: ssh shell: Process exited with status <N>`). The launcher
captures stderr to a tempfile at the launch-wrapper invocation and
uses `_extract_flyctl_remote_rc` (`scripts/remote/lib.sh`) to parse
the real remote code. Without this, the rc=75 branch never fires and
the generic `_launch_rc != 0` branch sets `container_rc=1`, causing
`decide_teardown` to pause (stop) the machine and kill the live
orchestrator.

The `--resume` smart router's auto-discovery scan honors
`LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` (the launcher exports it at line ~228 before
any verb dispatch) and falls back to `$USER_REPO/.leerie` for backward
compatibility, matching the pattern every other host-side verb uses.

### Host-side per-repo state directory

Resolves `LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR`: the host path where this repo's leerie
run state (`runs/`, `worktrees/`, etc.) is stored. Lives under `$HOME` so
Colima auto-shares it without an explicit `--mount` entry; keyed by repo
basename so each repo gets a readable, isolated subtree.

Default path: `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`. The default sits adjacent to
the installer's clone at `$HOME/.leerie/` (DESIGN §TBD) — the installer's
files live at the top level (`leerie` executable, `.git/`, `docs/`,
etc.), per-repo state dirs live as siblings (e.g.
`$HOME/.leerie/myproject/`). The launcher's `_validate_state_ownership`
check (below) catches the rare collision where a basename matches an
installer-dir marker (`.git/` or a `leerie` executable at top level
with no `runs/` subdir).

Resolution order (lowest → highest priority):

1. **Default** `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`. Computed by the
   `_state_dir_default` helper in the launcher as just the basename of
   `$USER_REPO`. No hashing; no `state/` segment.

2. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root** with key `state_dir`. Plain
   `key=value` syntax; bare `~` and `~/`-prefixed values are expanded to
   `$HOME`:

   ```
   state_dir = ~/.leerie/myproject
   ```

3. **`LEERIE_STATE_DIR`** environment variable. Overrides the default and
   any toml value; bare `~` and `~/`-prefixed values are expanded.

4. **`--state-dir PATH`** / `--state-dir=PATH` CLI flag. Highest priority;
   overrides everything. Launcher-only (stripped from `REWRITTEN_ARGS`;
   the orchestrator never sees it). Bare `~` and `~/`-prefixed values
   are expanded.

After resolution and before the verb dispatch, the launcher runs
`_validate_state_ownership` against the resolved path:

- **Fresh dir (does not exist):** create it and write `.owner` containing
  `$USER_REPO`.
- **Dir exists with matching `.owner`:** continue.
- **Dir exists with mismatched `.owner`:** error and exit. Two different
  repos share a basename; the operator must pick an explicit override
  (`--state-dir` / `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` / `leerie.toml: state_dir = ...`).
- **Dir exists, no `.owner`, contains `runs/` or `worktrees/`:** backfill
  the `.owner` sidecar from `$USER_REPO` (covers operators upgrading from
  the pre-`.owner` layout).
- **Dir exists, no `.owner`, contains `.git/` at top level or a `leerie`
  executable at top level:** error and exit. The dir looks like the
  leerie install directory, not a state dir.
- **Dir exists, no `.owner`, no recognizable markers (empty or
  unrelated):** claim it by writing `.owner`.

The check is skipped for `--version`, `config`, and the `--chain-*` verbs (those
talk to the chain Fly app or are host-only fast paths that don't touch local state).

Resolution and ownership validation live entirely in the launcher (bash);
no Python counterpart — the path is passed to `nerdctl run` as a
bind-mount volume argument once resolved. Tested by
`tests/test_resolve_state_dir.py` (resolver + ownership check, 27 cases).

> committed-default split as `--source-of-truth` and `--runtime`.

### State directory

Controls where leerie writes all run state (`state.json`, `runs/`, `logs/`,
etc.). By default, state is written to a per-repo subtree under `$HOME` —
never inside the repo itself — so target projects do not accumulate a
`.leerie/` directory and do not need to add anything to their `.gitignore`.
The default path is `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`, giving each repo an
isolated subtree keyed by basename. Cross-repo basename collisions are
caught at use time via an `.owner` sidecar (see
*Host-side per-repo state directory* above for the full check).

Resolution order (lowest → highest priority):

1. **Default** `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`. The basename of the
   absolute repo path.

2. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root** with key `state_dir`. Plain
   `key=value` syntax; bare `~` and `~/`-prefixed values are expanded to
   `$HOME`.

3. **`LEERIE_STATE_DIR`** environment variable — any non-empty value is
   expanded (`~/` → `$HOME/`) and used verbatim. Set once in your shell
   profile to keep all repos under a common directory.

4. **`--state-dir PATH`** / `--state-dir=PATH` CLI flag. Highest priority;
   overrides everything. Launcher-only (stripped from `REWRITTEN_ARGS`;
   the orchestrator never sees it). Bare `~` and `~/`-prefixed values
   are expanded.

Code counterpart: `resolve_leerie_root(repo_root)` in `leerie.py`;
constant `STATE_DIR_ENV = "LEERIE_STATE_DIR"`. All three `leerie_root`
assignments in `main()` call `resolve_leerie_root(Path(os.getcwd()))`.
The launcher resolves `LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` (the same value, before
container launch) via `_state_dir_default()` and passes it as the
`/leerie-state` bind-mount argument and via `-e LEERIE_STATE_DIR=/leerie-state`
so the orchestrator inside the container always writes to the mounted state
dir. See §0.5 *Bind-mount table* for the full mount specification.

### Runtime mode

Controls which execution backend runs the per-subtask worker containers.
`local` uses the local nerdctl/containerd runtime (the existing behavior);
`fly` routes each worker through Fly.io machines. Default is `local` so
existing behavior is unchanged for users who have not opted in.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--runtime`** CLI flag, values `local` | `fly`. Argparse rejects
   anything else before the orchestrator runs.

2. **`LEERIE_RUNTIME`** environment variable, same value set.

3. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root** with key `runtime`. Plain
   `key=value` syntax:

   ```
   runtime = fly
   ```

4. **Default `local`.** When unset, leerie runs workers in the local
   container runtime. The default preserves all existing behavior
   for users who have not configured a remote runtime.

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()` — bad
config is caught before any worker spawns. Valid values are
`{local, fly}`.

> The CLI/env > file order reflects the same session-scoped vs.
> committed-default split as `--source-of-truth`: the CLI flag and env
> var are one-off overrides, while `leerie.toml` is the per-repo default.

Maps to: `resolve_source_of_truth` resolution pattern in `leerie.py`
(`_read_toml_key` + env + CLI precedence). The code counterpart is
`resolve_runtime()` in `leerie.py`; constants are `RUNTIME_VALUES`,
`RUNTIME_ENV`, `RUNTIME_FILE`; argparse flag is `--runtime {local,fly}`.

### Fly app name

Fly.io app names are globally unique. `LEERIE_FLY_APP` is required when
`RUNTIME=fly`; the launcher `die()`s with setup instructions when unset.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--fly-app NAME`** / `--fly-app=NAME` CLI flag. Launcher-only
   (stripped from `REWRITTEN_ARGS`; the orchestrator never sees it).

2. **`$LEERIE_FLY_APP`** environment variable.

3. **(none)** — no default, no `leerie.toml` key. Required.

The resolved value is exported as `LEERIE_FLY_APP` and assigned to
`FLY_APP` before any remote script is sourced. Verb paths (`--stop`,
`--kill`, `--finalize`, `--list --runtime fly`, `--re-seed`) validate
independently since they exit before the main resolution gate.

### Prompt loading and the shared filter fragment

Worker prompts are loaded by `load_prompt(name)` in
`orchestrator/leerie.py` rather than `read_text()` directly. The
helper expands any `{{include: _foo.md}}` placeholder by inlining the
named fragment from `prompts/`. Fragments prefixed with `_` are
internal includes — never standalone worker prompts. Today there is
one fragment, `prompts/_clarification_filter.md`, included by
`prompts/classifier.md` and `prompts/implementer.md`. It is the single
source of truth for the codebase→research→ask wording shown to
workers; DESIGN.md §11 is the architectural spec that the fragment
must conform to.

### Confidence rounds

Planners and implementers self-gate on confidence (DESIGN §8) and loop their
evidence-gate up to `confidence_rounds` times before they exit `blocked`.
Default 8. Increase if the user wants workers to push harder on hard
diagnoses; decrease for cheaper, faster runs that accept earlier
escalations.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--confidence-rounds N`** CLI flag. Argparse rejects non-positive
   integers.
2. **`LEERIE_CONFIDENCE_ROUNDS`** environment variable, same value set.
3. **`leerie.toml` at the repo root**, `confidence_rounds = N`.
4. **Default `8`** (`DEFAULT_CAPS["confidence_rounds"]`).

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()`. The
resolved value is written into `caps["confidence_rounds"]` and passed in
each planner / implementer's user prompt — the cap is prompt-governed (see
§6 "Worker-internal caps" and DESIGN §13), the user-visible knob is real.

### Seed depth (shallow seeding)

Governs the fresh-provision `seed_repo_clone` transport for remote
(Fly) runs (DESIGN §6 *Shallow seeding for heavy repos*). Two knobs,
both resolved **in the `leerie` launcher** (bash — the Python
orchestrator never reads them, unlike `confidence_rounds`), mirroring
the `FLY_VM_DISK_GB` resolution pattern (CLI → env → `leerie.toml` →
default):

- **`LEERIE_SEED_DEPTH`** — the `git clone --depth=N` used when the
  shallow path fires. Resolution: `--seed-depth N` CLI > `LEERIE_SEED_DEPTH`
  env > `leerie.toml` `seed_depth = N` > **default `50`**. `0` means
  *full history* — it disables shallow seeding entirely and forces the
  full `--all` bundle regardless of repo size. Must be a non-negative
  integer; an invalid value is rejected at startup via a launcher exit.
- **`LEERIE_SEED_SHALLOW_THRESHOLD_MB`** — the repo `.git` size (MB)
  above which the shallow path activates. Resolution:
  `--seed-shallow-threshold-mb N` CLI > env >
  `leerie.toml` `seed_shallow_threshold_mb = N` > **default `200`**.
  Must be a positive integer. Below the threshold, the full-bundle
  path is used (costs nothing to ship for small repos).

Both are `export`ed into the environment `seed-repo.sh` reads. The
shallow path fires only when `LEERIE_SEED_DEPTH != 0`, `.git` size (via
`du -sk`) exceeds the threshold, **and** the working branch name is
shell-safe (`^[A-Za-z0-9/._-]+$`); otherwise `seed_repo_clone` falls
back to the full `git bundle --all` path. The launcher **strips** both
flags (and their values) from `REWRITTEN_ARGS` — the same way it
handles `--fly-app` / `--state-dir` — so they never reach the
orchestrator's strict `parse_args()` (the orchestrator declares no
argument for either; it would otherwise error `unrecognized
arguments`). `tests/test_launcher_value_flags_coupling.py` guards this.

On resume, the launcher additionally probes `/work` validity with a
**token-based** `flyctl ssh console` command that always exits 0 when
SSH works and prints `VALID` (`/work/.git` present and `git -C /work
rev-parse --verify HEAD` succeeds) or `INVALID`. The destructive full
`seed_repo` (which wipes + re-clones `/work`) runs **only** on a
confirmed round-trip returning `INVALID` (initial seed never
completed); a `VALID` result — or an **inconclusive probe** (non-zero
flyctl rc, e.g. a transient SSH failure) — takes the non-wiping
dirty-only `re_seed` path, so a valid `/work` with a run branch is
never obliterated by a transport blip. The probe rc is captured via
`|| _work_probe_rc=$?` so a failing `flyctl` does not trip the
launcher's `set -e`. (DESIGN §6 *Shallow seeding for heavy repos*,
resume corollary.)

### Verbosity

Controls how much of the per-worker activity surfaces to the
orchestrator log. Per-worker `<state-root>/logs/<sid>.log` files are
always written with the full raw event stream — verbosity governs
only the *inline* summary lines. Four named levels with stackable
`-v`/`-q` shortcuts, following the clig.dev / cargo / kubectl
convention.

| Level    | Flag             | What you see inline |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `quiet`  | `-qq` / `--verbosity quiet` | Phase boundaries, final result, errors only |
| `normal` | `-q` | Phase boundaries + per-subtask status changes (leerie's pre-streaming behavior) |
| `stream` | `-v` / (default) | `normal` + one-line summary per worker event |
| `debug`  | `-vv` / `--verbosity debug` | `stream` + raw event payloads, tool I/O, schema diffs, retry diagnostics |

Streaming log lines for Phase 5 work carry an activity prefix:

```
[wave 1 of 1 · running 5 subtasks]                         # wave start
[wave 1 of 1 · running 2 subtasks · 3 subtasks done]       # mid-wave
[wave 1 of 1 · 1 subtask in conformer · 4 subtasks done]   # last subtask in advisory phase
[wave 1 of 1 · 5 subtasks done]                            # wave fully settled
```

The prefix is built from three per-wave counters, each rendered as its
own ` · `-separated segment when non-zero (segments with a zero count
are omitted entirely, so `0/M`-style fragments never appear):

- **`running N subtask(s)`** — implementer not yet at terminal status
  (no entry in `subtask_status[sid]`, or value not in
  `_TERMINAL_STATUSES = {complete, failed, blocked}`).
- **`N subtask(s) in conformer`** — implementer reached `complete` and
  the advisory conformer phase is still in flight. The signal is
  `subtask_status[sid] == "complete"` *and* `conformance[sid]` absent —
  the conformance dict is written by `settle_subtask` exactly when the
  conformer settles, so this is a precise live indicator (DESIGN §9
  *Post-work conformance*).
- **`N subtask(s) done`** — implementer settled *and*, if `complete`,
  the conformer has also wrapped; or implementer hit `failed` /
  `blocked` (terminal regardless of conformer). Always rendered last so
  rising progress reads on the right side of the prefix.

The wave header `wave W of V` is the 1-based current wave index and
total wave count. Counts are restricted to the current wave's
membership (`waves[completed_waves]`), not the whole run — that's what
keeps `running 5 subtasks` meaningful at wave start.

Singular/plural is rendered on the count (`1 subtask` vs `5 subtasks`).

Built by `_get_progress` (`orchestrator/leerie.py`); emitted only after
Phase 3 schedules the waves, which is why classifier / planner /
reconciler log lines have no prefix. Post-wave-loop workers
(`summarizer`, `pr_writer`, `run_final_conformance`) also emit no prefix:
`_get_progress` returns `None` once `completed_waves >= len(waves)`,
since there is no in-flight wave to count.

`_invoke` takes `progress` as a callable (`Callable[[], tuple[...] |
None] | None`), not a spawn-time snapshot, and calls it per stream
event. This is so a long-running worker's prefix advances as siblings
complete — two workers logging at the same wall-clock instant agree on
the count instead of carrying frozen snapshots from their respective
spawn moments.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--verbosity LEVEL`** CLI flag, values `quiet` / `normal` /
   `stream` / `debug`. Argparse rejects anything else.
2. **`-v` / `-vv` / `-q` / `-qq`** shortcuts. These anchor to
   `normal` (not to the resolved default), so `-v` always means
   "show me the streaming feature" and `-q` always means "back to
   the pre-streaming terse output", independent of what
   env-var / TOML defaults are set to.
3. **`LEERIE_VERBOSITY`** environment variable.
4. **`leerie.toml`**, `verbosity = "stream"`.
5. **Default `stream`** (`VERBOSITY_DEFAULT`).

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()`.
Errors always emit at every level (clig.dev "errors emit at every
level" anti-pattern guard) — `quiet` does NOT suppress error
messages, only the per-event chatter.

The resolved value lives on `st.data["verbosity"]` and is
re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume` — the user
can dial up or down at resume time without editing state.

### Inspect directories

Extra directories the inspect-bucket workers (classifier, planner,
reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, provision) may read. Forwarded to each `claude -p` invocation as
one `--add-dir` flag per entry. Use this when a task references a
sibling repo outside the current repo cwd — for example, "compare
how beacon and leerie handle X, beacon is at `~/src/enric/beacon`":
without `--inspect-dir ~/src/enric/beacon`, the classifier and
planner cannot `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` that path, and an attempt to
fall back to `ls`/`find` is blocked by the workspace sandbox even
though `INSPECT_TOOLS` allowlists those verbs.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--inspect-dir PATH`** CLI flag, repeatable.
2. **`LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS`** environment variable, colon-separated.
3. **`leerie.toml`**, `inspect_dirs = "/abs/path/a,/abs/path/b"`
   (a comma-separated string, parsed by `_read_toml_key`).
4. **Default** `[]` (no extra directories).

Paths are expanded (`~` → `$HOME`) and resolved to absolute form at
startup. Duplicates are removed. The resolved list lives on
`st.data["inspect_dirs"]` and is re-resolved fresh on every run,
including `--resume`, so the user can add or remove paths without
editing state.

This applies only to inspect-bucket workers. Acting workers
(implementer, integrator, conformer) run inside the wave's worktree.
Those workers have `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and operate on the
worktree copy, not the user's wider filesystem — `--add-dir` is
unneeded.

### Telemetry

Telemetry is **always on and not configurable** — there is no enable flag. Per
DESIGN §14, the orchestrator unconditionally writes a per-run append-only
`calls.ndjson` (one JSON record per `claude -p` call) at the run root
`<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/calls.ndjson`, plus a `memory.ndjson` resource-usage
sampler and a `telemetry` aggregate block in `state.json`
(`{calls, cost_usd, input_tokens, output_tokens}`). All three live under
`<state-root>/` (outside the repo), so no `.gitignore` entry is needed. The
per-record schema is specified in §10; consumers are the `judge`/`heal` phases
(§14) and the `--report` verb (below).

### Judge output directory

The subdirectory name (relative to `<run-dir>`) where LLM judge output files
are written.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--judge-dir DIR`** CLI flag.
2. **`LEERIE_JUDGE_DIR`** environment variable.
3. **`leerie.toml`**, `judge_dir = "judge-out"`.
4. **Default `"judge-out"`** (`JUDGE_DIR_DEFAULT`).

### Heal output directory

The subdirectory name (relative to `<run-dir>`) where LLM self-heal loop output
files are written.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--heal-dir DIR`** CLI flag.
2. **`LEERIE_HEAL_DIR`** environment variable.
3. **`leerie.toml`**, `heal_dir = "heal-out"`.
4. **Default `"heal-out"`** (`HEAL_DIR_DEFAULT`).

### Judge model

The `claude` model alias used when the judge skill spawns a worker to score a
batch of captured calls. The judge does not require broad-context judgment like
the orchestrator's core workers — `sonnet` is the right default for throughput.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--judge-model MODEL`** CLI flag.
2. **`LEERIE_MODEL_JUDGE`** environment variable.
3. **`leerie.toml`**, `model_judge = "sonnet"`.
4. **Default `"sonnet"`** (`MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER["judge"]`).

### Heal model

The `claude` model alias used when the self-heal skill spawns workers for patch
generation and patched-arm replay.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--heal-model MODEL`** CLI flag.
2. **`LEERIE_MODEL_HEAL`** environment variable.
3. **`leerie.toml`**, `model_heal = "sonnet"`.
4. **Default `"sonnet"`** (`MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER["heal"]`).

### PR-writer model

The `claude` model alias used at finalize time by the `pr_writer` worker
that composes the PR title and body. The worker reads the target repo's
PR template (if any), the run's commit log, and a sampled diff, then
emits a JSON object with `title`, `body`, and `used_template`. The host
launcher reads the result from `run.json` and passes it to
`gh pr create`.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--pr-writer-model MODEL`** CLI flag.
2. **`LEERIE_MODEL_PR_WRITER`** environment variable.
3. **`leerie.toml`**, `model_pr_writer = "sonnet"`.
4. **Default `"sonnet"`** (`MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER["pr_writer"]`).

### PR template selector

When the target repo has multiple PR templates inside a
`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory, leerie picks the alphabetically first
`.md` by default. A repo-specific override selects a different basename
(with or without the `.md` suffix). Has no effect when the repo has a
single top-level template (e.g. `.github/pull_request_template.md`) or
no template at all.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--pr-template NAME`** CLI flag.
2. **`LEERIE_PR_TEMPLATE`** environment variable.
3. **`leerie.toml`**, `pr_template = "bug"`.
4. **Default**: alphabetically first `.md` in the discovered directory.

An override that does not match an existing template is **not fatal** —
finalize must not block over a cosmetic preference — leerie logs a
warning and falls back to the alphabetical default.

### PR-writer payload caps

The `pr_writer` worker is invoked by passing its entire user prompt
(task text, classification, subtask titles, full commit log, diff
stat/dirstat, sampled diff, and the PR template body — all serialized
as one JSON string) as a single argv element to `claude -p`. Linux
`ARG_MAX` in the leerie container (Debian 13) defaults to ~128 KB; a
degenerate run with thousands of commits, a huge template, or a
sprawling diff would silently fail with `E2BIG`.

Three constants in `orchestrator/leerie.py` cap the unbounded fields so
the total payload stays well under that ceiling. Each capped field
gets an in-band `... [<label> truncated at ~N KB; remainder omitted —
rely on the commit log] ...` sentinel so the worker can see the
truncation and avoid fabricating detail past the cut-off.

| Constant | Default | Bounds |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `PR_WRITER_COMMIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES` | 80,000 | full `git log --no-merges` between `working_branch` and `run_branch` |
| `PR_WRITER_TEMPLATE_MAX_BYTES`   | 32,000 | contents of the resolved PR template file |
| `PR_WRITER_DIFF_SAMPLE_MAX_LINES`| 500    | sampled `git diff` hunks (line-capped because individual diff lines can be long and breaking one mid-line would render the surrounding hunk unreadable) |
| `PR_WRITER_FINAL_CONFORMANCE_MAX_BYTES` | 8,000 | serialized JSON length of the `final_conformance` payload field. Enforced inside `_final_conformance_payload` by trimming `warnings` (then `residuals`) from the tail; at least one of each is preserved and a `truncated: true` marker is added when trimming fired |

These are **module constants, not `DEFAULT_CAPS` entries**, by
design. `DEFAULT_CAPS` is the surface for run-wide operational caps
that are intended to be user-tunable through CLI / env / TOML
(`max_total_workers`, `worker_timeout_sec`, `worker_memory_max_bytes`,
etc.). The PR-writer caps are internal protocol limits defending a
single subprocess invocation against an OS-imposed argv ceiling:
lowering them silently degrades summaries and raising them risks
`E2BIG`. `tests/test_pr_writer_payload_cap.py::test_pr_writer_byte_budgets_defined`
pins the values so any future change goes through code review.

Multi-byte UTF-8 safety: `_cap_text` slices at the byte boundary,
then back-decodes with `errors="ignore"` so the trimmed prefix never
ends mid-codepoint. Tested with rocket emojis (U+1F680, four UTF-8
bytes) that would naively split at the chosen byte boundary.

**`final_conformance` payload field** — when `run_final_conformance`
produced a result, `_compose_pr_via_llm` reads
`st.data["conformance"]["_final"]` and adds a compact
`final_conformance` object to the pr_writer payload with
`{residuals: [...], failed_axes: [...], warnings: [...]}` (plus an
optional `truncated: true` marker). Omitted when the final pass was
skipped, crashed, or returned a fully clean result (no residuals,
every axis `ran:false` or `passed:true`, no warnings) — the absence
of the field is the cue that there is nothing advisory to say. The
serialized JSON is bounded by
`PR_WRITER_FINAL_CONFORMANCE_MAX_BYTES` (8 KB), enforced in
`_final_conformance_payload` by trimming `warnings` (then `residuals`)
from the tail until the field fits; at least one of each is
preserved and the `truncated` marker is set so the prompt can
mention the cut-off honestly. The cap defends a payload already
sized close to the ~128 KB Linux ARG_MAX limit on the leerie
container.

### Heal-loop convergence parameters

Knobs governing the self-heal loop's iteration limit, pass-rate target, plateau
detection, and budget guard. All default values match Beacon's `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
(prior art at `scripts/heal-loop.ts:154`).

| Knob | CLI flag | Env var | TOML key | Default |
|------|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| Max iterations per call_type | `--heal-max-rounds N` | `LEERIE_HEAL_MAX_ROUNDS` | `heal_max_rounds = 10` | `10` (`HEAL_MAX_ROUNDS_DEFAULT`) |
| Success pass-rate threshold | `--heal-success-threshold F` | `LEERIE_HEAL_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` | `heal_success_threshold = 0.9` | `0.9` (`HEAL_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD_DEFAULT`) |
| Plateau detection window | — | — | — | `3` (`HEAL_PLATEAU_WINDOW_DEFAULT`; not user-tunable) |
| Plateau minimum delta | — | — | — | `0.03` (`HEAL_PLATEAU_DELTA_DEFAULT`; not user-tunable) |
| Per-call_type replay count | — | — | — | `5` (`HEAL_N_REPLAYS_DEFAULT`; not user-tunable) |

The plateau window, plateau delta, and replay count are not currently exposed
as CLI/env/TOML knobs — they are implementation constants. Only the user-facing
knobs (`--heal-max-rounds`, `--heal-success-threshold`) are CLI/env/TOML
resolvable. Resolution for both follows the standard precedence: CLI flag →
env var → `leerie.toml` → default.

### Model selection

Every worker shells out to `claude -p`. The model passed via `--model` to that
subprocess is resolved per worker type, so the same run can use `opus` for
judgment work and `sonnet` for high-throughput implementation. Valid values:
`sonnet` | `opus` | `haiku` (aliases — the `claude` CLI resolves them to the
current model version).

**Per-worker defaults: Opus for judgment, Sonnet for implementation, post-run analysis, and finalize-time composition.**
Workers that exercise broad-context judgment (classify the task, decompose
into subtasks, reconcile cross-domain coupling, detect cross-planner surface
overlap, resolve merge conflicts behaviorally, check criteria) default to
Opus. The implementer, conformer, judge, heal, and pr_writer workers —
which execute concrete tasks with high throughput requirements (implementer,
conformer) or run as one-shot post-run / finalize calls (judge, heal,
pr_writer) — default to Sonnet.

| Worker       | Default | Why |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| classifier   | opus    | global judgment over the task description |
| planner      | opus    | decomposition is the load-bearing judgment step |
| reconciler   | opus    | cross-domain tag equivalence is judgment |
| plan_overlap_judge | opus | surface-overlap detection over the reconciled plan is judgment (two planners independently extracting the same artifact with incompatible APIs — DESIGN §5 *Cross-domain surface overlap*) |
| satisfied_probe | sonnet | per-subtask "is this already met on the base tree?" check (DESIGN §8 *Already-satisfied subtask elimination*); runs once per subtask so throughput/cost dominates — same profile as conformer/judge. The false-positive risk is contained by the base-tree-only tool scope + conservative-default prompt, not by model tier |
| provision    | opus    | fallback when the deterministic lockfile-detection table returns empty (DESIGN §6½); reads README + configs to emit an install recipe — judgment over arbitrary repo shapes |
| integrator   | opus    | behavioral conflict resolution; a wrong merge silently corrupts integrated state |
| implementer  | sonnet  | concrete subtask execution; Sonnet's throughput is the right tradeoff |
| conformer    | sonnet  | reads a diff and runs commands; same throughput-first profile as implementer; the phase is advisory so a borderline judgment call costs at most a warning |
| judge        | sonnet  | scoring a batch of captured calls; throughput matters more than broad judgment |
| heal (patch) | sonnet  | patch generation and replay; throughput matters more than broad judgment |
| pr_writer    | sonnet  | finalize-time PR title + body; fills repo template when present, summarizes commits otherwise; throughput-shaped one-shot call |
| dep_capture  | opus    | finalize-time dep inference from worker logs; broad judgment over arbitrary shell command sets warrants full-tier reasoning |
| fit_judge    | opus    | P1 Task-Context Fit scoring is judgment; absent from `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` — opus default comes from the global `MODEL_DEFAULT` fallback |
| splitter     | opus    | LLM-driven structural partition (coupled-minority path) is judgment; absent from `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` — opus default comes from the global `MODEL_DEFAULT` fallback |

`MODEL_DEFAULT` is the global default (`opus`); `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`
overrides it for specific workers (`implementer`, `conformer`, `judge`,
`heal`, `pr_writer`, and `satisfied_probe` all default to `sonnet`).
`dep_capture`, `fit_judge`, and `splitter` are **absent** from
`MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` — their `opus` defaults come from the global
`MODEL_DEFAULT` fallback.

Resolution order for each worker type `W` (highest priority first):

1. **`--model-<W>`** CLI flag (e.g. `--model-implementer opus`)
2. **`--model`** CLI flag (sets the global default for this run)
3. **`LEERIE_MODEL_<W>`** env var (e.g. `LEERIE_MODEL_IMPLEMENTER=opus`)
4. **`LEERIE_MODEL`** env var (sets the global default)
5. **`model_<w>`** key in `leerie.toml`
6. **`model`** key in `leerie.toml`
7. **Per-worker default** from `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`
8. **Global default `MODEL_DEFAULT`** (`opus`)

Fifteen worker types (plus the global override), each independently overridable:

| Worker             | env var                           | CLI flag                     | TOML key                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| (global)           | `LEERIE_MODEL`                  | `--model`                    | `model`                   |
| classifier         | `LEERIE_MODEL_CLASSIFIER`       | `--model-classifier`         | `model_classifier`        |
| planner            | `LEERIE_MODEL_PLANNER`          | `--model-planner`            | `model_planner`           |
| reconciler         | `LEERIE_MODEL_RECONCILER`       | `--model-reconciler`         | `model_reconciler`        |
| plan_overlap_judge | `LEERIE_MODEL_PLAN_OVERLAP_JUDGE`| `--model-plan_overlap_judge` | `model_plan_overlap_judge`|
| satisfied_probe    | `LEERIE_MODEL_SATISFIED_PROBE`  | `--model-satisfied_probe`    | `model_satisfied_probe`   |
| provision          | `LEERIE_MODEL_PROVISION`        | `--model-provision`          | `model_provision`         |
| implementer        | `LEERIE_MODEL_IMPLEMENTER`      | `--model-implementer`        | `model_implementer`       |
| integrator         | `LEERIE_MODEL_INTEGRATOR`       | `--model-integrator`         | `model_integrator`        |
| conformer          | `LEERIE_MODEL_CONFORMER`        | `--model-conformer`          | `model_conformer`         |
| fit_judge          | `LEERIE_MODEL_FIT_JUDGE`        | `--model-fit_judge`          | `model_fit_judge`         |
| splitter           | `LEERIE_MODEL_SPLITTER`         | `--model-splitter`           | `model_splitter`          |
| judge              | `LEERIE_MODEL_JUDGE`            | `--judge-model`              | `model_judge`             |
| heal               | `LEERIE_MODEL_HEAL`             | `--heal-model`               | `model_heal`              |
| pr_writer          | `LEERIE_MODEL_PR_WRITER`        | `--pr-writer-model`          | `model_pr_writer`         |
| dep_capture        | `LEERIE_MODEL_DEP_CAPTURE`      | *(none)*                     | *(none)*                  |

Note: `judge`, `heal`, `pr_writer`, and `dep_capture` do not follow the
`--model-<W>` CLI flag pattern used by orchestrator workers, because they
are post-run / finalize-time workers invoked outside the main orchestrate loop.
`judge`, `heal`, and `pr_writer` have dedicated CLI flags; `dep_capture` has
**neither a CLI flag nor a `leerie.toml` key** — it supports the env-var
`LEERIE_MODEL_DEP_CAPTURE` override only. All four still honor the global
`--model` / `LEERIE_MODEL` override.

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()`. CLI
values are validated by argparse `choices=` and rejected with the standard
argparse error.

**Cost note:** Opus is materially more expensive than Sonnet. A user who
wants the old all-Sonnet behavior sets `LEERIE_MODEL=sonnet` (or
`--model sonnet`). Per-worker overrides (`--model-planner sonnet`) let
users selectively de-escalate individual workers.

Models are not persisted in `<state-root>/state.json`. On `--resume`, models are
re-resolved from the current environment, so changing `LEERIE_MODEL` between
the original run and the resume is intentional and takes effect.

### Effort selection

The `claude -p` CLI exposes `--effort {low,medium,high,xhigh,max}` to dial
reasoning depth. Leerie pins effort per worker so judgment workers think to a
consistent depth across runs — the previous behavior (no `--effort` flag,
worker inherits whatever the user's Claude settings happen to default to)
was a hidden source of cross-run variance in subtask count and other
judgment-shaped outputs.

The `claude -p` CLI exposes **no `--temperature` and no `--seed`**, so
sampling stochasticity cannot be pinned. Effort is the strongest dial
available; it does not eliminate run-to-run variance but does remove the
"this run thought harder than that one" axis.

**Per-worker defaults: `high` for judgment workers, unset for acting workers.**
Judgment workers (classifier, planner, reconciler, plan_overlap_judge,
provision, integrator) default to `high`. The acting workers (implementer,
conformer) and post-run skill workers (judge, heal) default to *unset* —
when no effort is resolved,
no `--effort` flag is passed and the worker inherits Claude's default. This
keeps acting workers' reasoning bounded by their own evidence gates
(DESIGN §8) rather than by a global dial.

| Worker       | Default | Why |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| classifier   | high    | category choice is judgment over the whole task |
| planner      | high    | decomposition granularity is the load-bearing judgment step (DESIGN §8 planner gate) |
| reconciler   | high    | cross-domain tag equivalence is judgment |
| plan_overlap_judge | high | surface-overlap detection over the reconciled plan is judgment (DESIGN §5 *Cross-domain surface overlap*); merge-feasibility discipline rewards pinning reasoning depth |
| satisfied_probe | unset | per-subtask advisory prune (DESIGN §8 *Already-satisfied subtask elimination*); runs once per subtask, same unset profile as conformer/judge — the base-tree-only tool scope and conservative default carry the correctness, not pinned depth |
| provision    | high    | recipe synthesis over arbitrary repo shapes is judgment |
| integrator   | high    | behavioral conflict resolution; a wrong merge corrupts state |
| implementer  | unset   | bounded by §8 evidence gate; pinning would override the gate's adaptive depth |
| conformer    | unset   | advisory phase; same reasoning as implementer |
| judge        | unset   | post-run scoring; no need to pin |
| heal         | unset   | post-run patch generation; no need to pin |
| pr_writer    | high    | one-shot finalize call; pin reasoning to keep template-fill discipline (preserve HTML comments, do not invent ticked checkboxes) consistent across runs |
| dep_capture  | high    | finalize-time dep inference; broad judgment over shell command sets benefits from pinned reasoning depth |
| fit_judge    | high    | P1 Task-Context Fit score is judgment over scope+context co-minimization; calibrated threshold (0.70) makes pinned depth the reproducibility dial |
| splitter     | high    | LLM-driven structural partition (coupled-minority path) is judgment over seam detection; wrong split corrupts downstream implementer context |

`EFFORT_DEFAULT` is `None` (meaning "don't pass `--effort`");
`EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` overrides it to `"high"` for the six judgment
workers above and for the finalize-time `pr_writer` and `dep_capture` workers,
and for the P1 decomposition workers `fit_judge` and `splitter`.

Resolution order for each worker type `W` (highest priority first), mirroring
model selection:

1. **`--effort-<W>`** CLI flag (e.g. `--effort-planner max`)
2. **`--effort`** CLI flag (sets the global default for this run)
3. **`LEERIE_EFFORT_<W>`** env var (e.g. `LEERIE_EFFORT_PLANNER=max`)
4. **`LEERIE_EFFORT`** env var (sets the global default)
5. **`effort_<w>`** key in `leerie.toml`
6. **`effort`** key in `leerie.toml`
7. **Per-worker default** from `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`
8. **Global default `EFFORT_DEFAULT`** (`None` — flag omitted)

| Worker             | env var                            | CLI flag                      | TOML key                   |

| fit_judge          | `LEERIE_EFFORT_FIT_JUDGE`        | `--effort-fit_judge`          | `effort_fit_judge`         |
| splitter           | `LEERIE_EFFORT_SPLITTER`         | `--effort-splitter`           | `effort_splitter`          |
| judge              | *(none)*                         | *(none)*                      | *(none)*                   |
| heal               | *(none)*                         | *(none)*                      | *(none)*                   |
| pr_writer          | *(none)*                         | *(none)*                      | *(none)*                   |
| dep_capture        | *(none)*                         | *(none)*                      | *(none)*                   |

Note: `judge`, `heal`, `pr_writer`, and `dep_capture` are post-run / finalize-time
workers not in `WORKER_TYPES`; they receive no per-worker effort override (no
dedicated env var, CLI flag, or TOML key). They do honor the global
`--effort` / `LEERIE_EFFORT` override.

An invalid value in env or file is rejected at startup via `die()`. CLI
values are validated by argparse `choices=`. A worker that resolves to `None`
(no override and no per-worker default) produces the exact same CLI as
before this feature landed — zero behavior change for unconfigured workers.

Efforts are not persisted in `<state-root>/state.json`. Like models, on `--resume`
they are re-resolved from the current environment.

### The `--answers` file

A JSON object keyed by classifier-assigned question `id`. Optionally
includes a `source_of_truth` key set to `"codebase"`, `"research"`, or
`"both"` to override the resolved preference for this run:

```json
{ "q1": "answer text", "source_of_truth": "codebase" }
```

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §11 (clarification procedure).

### Chain verbs

Chain orchestration is implemented as a **laptop-side wave
sequencer** in the `leerie` launcher (DESIGN.md §19). A chain is N
parallel copies of today's single-run `--runtime fly` flow per
wave, with synth-merge between waves to build the next wave's base
branch. The laptop is the sequencer; there is no Fly coordinator
machine, no per-chain SQLite, no 6PN HTTP.

The primary verb is `leerie --chain`. Chain-scoped verbs
(`--status`, `--stop`, `--kill`, `--resume`, `--finalize`,
`--attach`) detect UUID-formatted positional arguments and dispatch
by iterating `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/*/run.json` for runs with
matching `chain_id`.

| Verb | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `leerie --chain [--chain-id <uuid>] [<per-job-flags>] --wave <files> [--wave <files>] ...` (alias: `--chain-submit`) | Wave-sequencer loop. Any flags not consumed by `--chain`'s own parser (`--wave`, `--chain-id`, `--target`) are collected into a passthrough array and forwarded to each per-job `./leerie` invocation — so `--effort high`, `--model opus`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, etc. work the same as on a single run. Mints a fresh `chain_id` (UUID) unless `--chain-id <prior-uuid>` is supplied (in which case the prior chain's `chain_id` is reused so the wave-loop idempotency check skips already-pushed waves — see "Chain helpers" subsection below). For each wave N: if every wave-N run is already pushed (`_wave_already_done`), skip fan-out; else checks out `current_base` in `$USER_REPO` and fans out N background `./leerie "$prompt" --runtime fly <passthrough> --chain-id <id>` per prompt file, waits for all to finalize on the laptop (existing single-run path: `provision_machine` → `seed-auth.sh` → `seed-repo.sh` → orchestrator → `decide_teardown` trap → `fetch_branch` → `host_finalize` → `destroy_machine`), tags each finalized `run.json` with `chain_id` + `wave_idx` via `update_run_json`. Either way, gathers wave-N branches via `_wave_branches`, synth-merges into `leerie/stage/<chain-id>-wave-<N+1>` via `chain.git_ops.synth_merge_branches`, pushes the stage branch to origin, advances `current_base`. Trap handler `_ch_kill_wave` propagates SIGINT/SIGTERM to all in-flight wave children. |
| `leerie --status <chain-id>` (alias: `--chain-status`) | Iterates run.json files, filters by `chain_id`, renders one row per matched run (wave, run_id, status, branch, notes). Status derived from run.json fields (`pushed_at` / `paused_at` / `killed_at` / `finished_at`). |
| `leerie --attach <chain-id>` (alias: `--chain-attach`) | Polls run.json files every 5s; exits 0 when every chain run is in a terminal state (`pushed_at` / `paused_at` / `killed_at` / `sync_failed_at`). |
| `leerie --kill <chain-id>` (alias: `--chain-kill`) | Enumerates run.json files with matching `chain_id` whose machines aren't already destroyed (`killed_at` is null), invokes `leerie --kill <run-id>` per discovered run. Idempotent. |
| `leerie --stop <chain-id>` | Enumerates runs that are actively running (have `fly_machine_id`, no terminal state), invokes `leerie --stop <run-id>` per discovered run. |
| `leerie --resume <chain-id>` | Two tiers: (1) auto-resumes paused runs (`paused_at` set, not `killed_at`) by invoking `leerie --resume <run-id>` per discovered run; (2) lists still-running runs (have `fly_machine_id` + `chain_id`, no terminal state) with machine IDs so the user can reattach via `leerie --resume <machine-id>`. Running runs are discoverable because the child writes `chain_id` into host-side `run.json` immediately after provisioning (early-write), before the orchestrator starts. After paused runs complete, the user re-invokes `leerie --chain --chain-id <chain-id> --wave ...` to continue the wave loop from where it stopped. |
| `leerie --finalize <chain-id>` | Enumerates runs that haven't been pushed yet (`pushed_at` null, not `killed_at`), invokes `leerie --finalize <run-id>` per discovered run. |
| `leerie --list --chains` (alias: `--list-chains`) | Iterates run.json files, groups by `chain_id`, renders one row per chain (chain_id, status, pushed/total, wave count, started_at). |

Non-UUID positional ids fall through unchanged to the existing
single-run code paths. UUID detection uses the `8-4-4-4-12` hyphen
pattern.

**Test seam**: chain-scoped verbs use `${LEERIE_SELF_CMD:-"$0"}` for
the per-run recursive invocation, so tests can substitute a stub
binary via the `LEERIE_SELF_CMD` env var without faking `$0`. See
`tests/test_chain_launcher_id_dispatch.py`.

Chain verbs do NOT require `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `GH_DISPATCH_PAT`,
`LEERIE_CHAIN_IMAGE`, or `LEERIE_WORKER_IMAGE` — there is no
coordinator to provision. The per-job `./leerie --runtime fly`
invocations have their own env requirements unchanged.

#### Per-job lifecycle

Each wave job is a normal single-run `--runtime fly` invocation:

1. **Provision.** `scripts/remote/provision.sh::provision_machine` creates a
   Fly machine, writes `fly-machine.json` + `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/remote/<launcher-pid>.json`
   immediately after `flyctl machine run` succeeds.
2. **Seed.** `scripts/remote/seed-auth.sh` + `seed-repo.sh` ship the
   laptop's Claude credentials + git identity + working tree to the
   worker via `flyctl ssh console` tar pipe. `seed-auth.sh:149-158`
   excludes git-push credentials by design — workers never see them.
3. **Orchestrate.** The orchestrator runs the standard
   classify → plan → execute → finalize phases on the worker.
4. **Decide teardown.** When the orchestrator exits, the launcher's
   `decide_teardown` trap fires on the LAPTOP (it's a trap on the
   bash process that sourced provision.sh; the worker's exit
   propagates via the SSH session's tail wrapper). The trap calls
   `fetch_branch` (pulls bundle + run-state), `host_finalize`
   (pushes branch + opens PR), `destroy_machine` (Fly DELETE).

The chain wave loop catches each per-job exit via `wait` and
captures the rc. The launcher_pid recorded in
`$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/remote/<pid>.json` is `$!` from the parent's
background spawn, which lets the wave loop discover each child's
`fly_machine_id` (= run_id) and tag the run with `chain_id` /
`wave_idx`.

#### chain_id discovery for chain-scoped verbs

The `chain_id` (UUID minted by `--chain`) is written into each
chain run's `run.json` by the wave loop AFTER `host_finalize`
completes for that run. The launcher's `update_run_json` bash
helper (`scripts/remote/lib.sh:42`) merges the field atomically into
the existing JSON.

The tagging loop discovers each child's machine ID via two paths
(tried in order):

1. **Primary:** `remote/<child-pid>.json` — the PID-keyed pointer
   written by `provision.sh` during provisioning.
2. **Fallback:** scan `runs/*/fly-machine.json` for a matching
   `launcher_pid` field. This path fires when the pointer file is
   absent (e.g., older images whose `destroy_machine()` deleted
   it before the parent could read it).

All chain-scoped verbs operate by iterating
`$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/*/run.json`, parsing each with
`json.load`, and filtering by the `chain_id` field. The standard
`for run_json in "$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR"/runs/*/run.json` glob
(established in `leerie:3330-3347` for auto-finalize) is the shared
discovery pattern.

#### Chain helpers (launcher bash)

Three private launcher helpers near `_json_get` implement the
discovery + idempotency primitives the wave loop and chain-scoped
verbs build on. Each runs a self-contained `python3 - … <<'PY'`
heredoc against `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR`; none access global bash
state besides `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR`. Args come through positional
parameters (no env interpolation into Python source).

| Helper | Args | Contract |
|--------|------|----------|
| `_wave_already_done <chain_id> <wave_idx> <n_expected>` | UUID, integer, integer | Exits 0 iff `n_expected` runs are tagged with `chain_id` + `wave_idx` AND every matching run has `pushed_at` set. Used by the `--chain` wave loop to skip fan-out on a resume submission. |
| `_wave_branches <chain_id> <wave_idx>` | UUID, integer | Emits one branch-name per line for every matching run. Used by the wave loop to gather wave-N branches for synth-merge (works for both the just-fanned path and the resume path). |
| `_chain_runs_filter <chain_id> <verb>` | UUID, one of `stop`/`kill`/`finalize`/`resume`/`running` | Emits matching run-ids one per line. The `verb` parameter selects a hardcoded filter inside the heredoc (`stop`: machine running; `kill`: not yet destroyed; `finalize`: not yet pushed; `resume`: paused; `running`: active with chain_id, no terminal state). Used by the chain-scoped verb arms (`--stop`/`--kill`/`--finalize`/`--resume`) to enumerate runs for per-run dispatch. Returns rc=2 + `remote_log` error on unknown verb (bash-side assert; Python heredoc has its own `sys.exit(2)` backstop). |

The wave loop's tag-write step (`update_run_json … chain_id "$_ch_id"
wave_idx "$_wave_idx"`) fires BEFORE the failure-pause check so
runs that paused on failure still get tagged and are therefore
discoverable by `leerie --resume <chain-id>` / `--kill <chain-id>` /
etc. The `_ch_wave_pids` / `_ch_wave_child_pids` arrays reset at
the top of every wave iteration (above the `_wave_already_done`
check) so the SIGINT trap handler never sees stale entries from a
prior wave.

##### Resuming a chain via `--chain --chain-id <uuid>`

`leerie --chain --chain-id <prior-uuid> --wave …` pins the chain_id
to a prior chain's UUID instead of minting fresh. The wave loop's
`_wave_already_done` check then matches the prior chain's runs and
skips fan-out for already-pushed waves, advancing `current_base`
through any wave-staging branches already pushed to origin. This is
the load-bearing recovery path after `leerie --resume <chain-id>`
unpauses every paused run: the user re-submits with `--chain-id
<prior-uuid>` and the chain picks up at the first not-yet-done
wave.

The launcher normalizes the user-supplied chain_id to lowercase via
`tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` after UUID format validation. The
validation regex (`UUID_PATTERN`, defined near the top of the
launcher) is case-insensitive (`grep -qiE`) so uppercase input
passes; but the wave-loop helpers compare against `run.json`'s
`chain_id` field case-sensitively, and `uuid.uuid4()` always emits
lowercase. Without normalization, uppercase `--chain-id` input
would silently bypass idempotency and fork the chain into two
chain_ids — the v8 audit's S1 finding.

##### Synth-merge idempotency probe

Before invoking `chain.git_ops.synth_merge_branches` for wave
N → N+1, the wave loop probes origin via `git ls-remote
--exit-code origin leerie/stage/<chain-id>-wave-<N+1>`. If the
stage branch already exists (e.g., the user manually resolved a
prior synth-merge conflict and pushed), the wave loop fetches +
checks out the existing branch and skips synth-merge entirely.
Without this probe, `synth_merge_branches`'s `git checkout -B`
would force-recreate the stage branch from `$current_base`,
discarding the user's resolved state, and then re-merge the same
wave-N branches — re-conflicting in exactly the same way that
prompted the resume.

#### Synth-merge between waves

After every wave-N job's `host_finalize` has pushed its branch to
origin, the wave loop runs synth-merge to build the next wave's
base branch:

```bash
python3 -c "
from chain.git_ops import synth_merge_branches, SynthMergeConflict
synth_merge_branches('$USER_REPO', '$current_base',
                     ['leerie/runs/...', ...],
                     'leerie/stage/<chain-id>-wave-<N+1>')
"
```

`synth_merge_branches` runs in `$USER_REPO`, does `git fetch
origin` + `git checkout -B <stage> origin/<base>` + sequential
`git merge --no-ff --no-edit origin/<branch>`. Conflicts raise
`SynthMergeConflict`; the wave loop catches and pauses the chain
with a clear message for manual resolution. The function works
unchanged from its v3 form — branches are on origin (each wave-N
job's `host_finalize` pushed it), so the `origin/<branch>`
references resolve.

After synth-merge, the wave loop pushes the stage branch to origin
so wave-N+1 workers can see it as their starting base.

#### Idempotent resume

If the user Ctrl-Cs mid-chain or any job fails, the wave loop
exits non-zero with a resume hint. To resume:

1. `leerie --resume <chain-id>` resumes every paused run (existing
   single-run resume per discovered run).
2. After paused runs complete, the user re-invokes
   `leerie --chain --wave ...`. The wave loop's idempotency check
   (waves whose runs are all already `pushed_at` are skipped) lets
   the chain pick up from where it stopped.

The canonical "this run is done, don't re-spawn" sentinel is
`pushed_at` being set on the run.json — written by `host_finalize`
after `git push -u origin <branch>` succeeds. This is the same
sentinel `host_finalize` itself uses for push idempotency.

#### chain.git_ops surface (laptop-side)

`chain/git_ops.py` provides the git operations invoked by the wave
loop. Workers never invoke this module; all GitHub credential
touches happen on the laptop using its existing `gh auth` and
`~/.git-credentials`.

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `synth_merge_branches(repo, base_branch, dep_branches, stage_name)` | Build a stage branch by merging each dep branch into a fresh checkout of `base_branch`; raises `SynthMergeConflict` on any conflict. Used by the wave loop between waves. Passes `-c user.email=leerie-chain@bot.invalid -c user.name=leerie-chain` to `git merge` defensively so the merge commit succeeds even when the laptop's global git identity is unset (otherwise the merge would fail with "Committer identity unknown"). |
| `clone_target(url, pat, dest)`, `fetch_branch`, `push_branch`, `open_pr`, `finalize_run`, `write_audit_artifact` | Kept for compatibility with existing tests and any future automated paths; the wave loop MVP uses only `synth_merge_branches`. |

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §19 *Chain orchestration*.

### Run-group verbs

Run-group orchestration launches N ordinary single-repo leerie runs
together as a coordinated unit, sharing a `group_id` (DESIGN.md §20).
Each member is an unchanged, fully isolated run with its own
basename-keyed state directory, its own run branch, its own PR, and
its own resume record. The group layer adds a shared brief,
read-only cross-repo visibility via `--inspect-dir`, deploy-ordering
notes, and group-scoped verbs — nothing else.

**Contrast with chains (§19):** chain-scoped verbs scan ONE state
directory for `chain_id`; group-scoped verbs must scan ACROSS the set
of member state directories (one per member repo basename). The two
subsystems are complementary in design spirit but do not share
discovery machinery — `_chain_runs_filter` (`leerie:191`) assumes a
single `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` and cannot be reused directly.

#### `group_id` in `run.json`

`group_id` is an optional string field in `run.json`. It is written
at two points: (1) by the orchestrator at run-start when `--group-id`
is supplied as a CLI arg (`orchestrator/leerie.py:15061`), so the
field appears in `run.json` immediately when the run begins; and (2)
by the `--group` launcher arm after all members complete, via
`update_run_json … group_id "$_group_id"` (the tag-back step in
`leerie`). The `chain_id` field follows the same pattern.
`_validate_run_json`
(`orchestrator/leerie.py:1994`) does not add any invariant check on
`group_id` — it is informational and orthogonal to the push/pause/kill
state machine. The field is accepted by the validator without error
because validators only check fields they know about (unknown keys pass
through).

#### Launcher `--group` verb

```
leerie --group \
  --repo <path> "<prompt>" \
  --repo <path> "<prompt>" \
  [--brief <file>] \
  [<per-member-flags>]
```

Modeled on the `--chain` arm (`leerie:2033`). The `--group` arm:

1. Parses repeated `--repo <path> "<prompt>"` pairs and an optional
   `--brief <file>`.
2. Fails fast if any repo path is not a git repository (mirrors
   the chain prompt-file check at `leerie:2136`).
3. Mints a `_group_id` (UUID, same mechanism as `--chain`'s `_ch_id`).
4. **State-dir guard (mandatory).** Rejects or per-member-namespaces
   any `--state-dir` / `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` override in the calling
   environment. These override `_state_dir_default` (`:431`) and would
   pin every member to one shared state directory, causing a `.owner`
   collision on member 2. Chains (one repo) forward these safely;
   groups (N repos) must not. The guard must fire before any member
   is backgrounded.
5. Per member: builds the prompt as `<brief>\n\n<member prompt>`,
   appends `--inspect-dir <sibling-repo>` for every other member
   (reusing the inspect-dir translation at `leerie:3337`+), and
   backgrounds:
   ```bash
   # resolved once, before any cd, to an absolute path:
   _grp_self_cmd="${LEERIE_SELF_CMD:-$_grp_leerie_dir/$(basename "$0")}"
   ( cd <repo> && "$_grp_self_cmd" "<prompt>" <flags> \
       --group-id "$_group_id" ) &
   ```
   (mirrors `leerie:2237-2246` for chains). Each `cd` makes the member
   resolve its own `USER_REPO` and basename-keyed state directory
   independently. The self-command **must** be absolutized *before* the
   `cd`: a relative `$0` (e.g. `./leerie`, the documented quick-start
   form) would not resolve from the member's cwd once the subshell has
   `cd`'d into the member repo. Unlike chains — which never `cd`, so a
   relative `$0` still resolves — the group fan-out changes directory,
   so it anchors `$0` to the launcher's own resolved dir first.
6. Waits for all members (`wait`), then runs group tag-back (below).

Per-member flags are forwarded like `_ch_passthrough` for chains.
`LEERIE_SELF_CMD` is the same test seam used by chain verbs — it still
takes precedence in `_grp_self_cmd`, so tests substitute a stub binary
via `LEERIE_SELF_CMD`.

#### Group tag-back across state directories (both runtimes)

After `wait`, the launcher writes `group_id` into each member's
`run.json`. Because each member runs in its own `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`
state directory, the launcher must discover each member's run directory
from its per-member state dir, not from `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR`.

The launcher knows each child's PID (`$!`) and repo path (→ basename →
state dir), so the discovery is:

| Runtime | Discovery mechanism |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Local** | After `wait` on a member, scan `~/.leerie/<member-basename>/runs/*/run.json` for the newest file with `finished_at` set (the `--group` arm's tag-back loop in `leerie`). No cidfile read, no `--rm` race — the `run.json` is durably on disk by the time `wait` returns. |
| **Fly** | The existing `remote/<child-pid>.json` / `fly-machine.json` pointer path (`leerie:2263-2289`), applied per-member using the member's own state dir. The child's PID is `$!`; the member's state dir is resolved from its basename. |

After discovering each member's `run.json`, the launcher calls
`update_run_json … group_id "$_group_id"` (the same
runtime-agnostic atomic merge used by the chain wave loop,
`scripts/remote/lib.sh:70`).

No new per-child pointer file is required: the durable
`run.json`-on-disk is the coordination artifact, consistent with how
chains discover their members.

#### Group-scoped verbs

| Verb | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `leerie --group --repo <path> "<prompt>" [--repo ...] [--brief <file>] [--group-id <uuid>]` | Fan-out launcher. Mints a fresh `group_id` unless `--group-id <prior-uuid>` is supplied. Fans out one backgrounded member invocation per `--repo`, waits, then runs group tag-back. |
| `leerie --status <group-id>` | Iterates member state dirs (derived from the group's member repos or a group-manifest the launcher drops), filters `run.json` by `group_id`, renders one row per matched run (run_id, status, branch, notes). Same field-derived status as chain `--status`. |
| `leerie --stop <group-id>` | Discovers running Fly members across all member state dirs; invokes `leerie --stop <run-id>` per discovered run. Fly-runtime only (pauses machines). |
| `leerie --resume <group-id>` | Discovers paused members across all member state dirs; invokes `leerie --resume <run-id>` per discovered paused run. |
| `leerie --kill <group-id>` | Discovers non-destroyed members across all member state dirs; invokes `leerie --kill <run-id>` per discovered run. Idempotent. |
| `leerie --finalize <group-id>` | Discovers members not yet pushed across all member state dirs; invokes `leerie --finalize <run-id>` per discovered run. |
| `leerie --list --groups` | Iterates across all leerie state dirs under `$HOME/.leerie/`, groups `run.json` files by `group_id`, renders one row per group (group_id, status, member count). |

These verbs are dispatched by UUID detection (same `8-4-4-4-12` hyphen
pattern as chain verbs). A UUID that matches a `group_id` across member
state dirs is a group-scoped dispatch.

#### `_group_runs_filter`

The group-scoped verb implementations build on `_group_runs_filter`,
a private launcher helper that scans a **set** of state directories
(one per member repo basename) for `run.json` files tagged with a
given `group_id`. Signature:

```
_group_runs_filter <group_id> <verb> <state_dir_1> [<state_dir_2> ...]
```

Emits matching run-ids one per line, filtered by the same per-verb
logic as `_chain_runs_filter` (`stop` / `kill` / `finalize` / `resume`
/ `running`). The key difference: `_chain_runs_filter` iterates
`$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/*/run.json` (one directory); `_group_runs_filter`
iterates `<state_dir_N>/runs/*/run.json` for each supplied directory.

#### Deploy-ordering notes

When a member's planner declares a cross-repo prerequisite as
`requires.extent: external` (DESIGN.md §5), those entries accumulate
in `State.data["external_preconditions"]` (written at plan time,
`orchestrator/leerie.py:9727`). The entry shape is:
`{tag, reasons:[{sid, reason}], originating_subtasks}`.

The deploy-note plumbing threads `external_preconditions` from State
into the finalize path at three points:

1. **`_compose_pr_via_llm` payload** (`orchestrator/leerie.py:14590`):
   `external_preconditions` is added as a field in the JSON payload
   passed to the `pr_writer` worker, alongside `task`, `commit_log`,
   etc. The pr_writer prompt instructs the worker to render a
   "⚠ Deploy-ordering" section when the field is non-empty.

2. **`compose_pr_body` fallback** (`orchestrator/leerie.py:2119`):
   The deterministic Python fallback PR body is extended to render a
   "⚠ Deploy-ordering" section from `external_preconditions` when
   present in state. This ensures the deploy note appears even when
   the `pr_writer` LLM worker fails or is skipped.

3. **`host-finalize.sh` bash fallback** (`scripts/host-finalize.sh`):
   the pure-bash deterministic PR body (used when neither `pr_body`
   from the `pr_writer` worker nor the Python `compose_pr_body` output
   reached `run.json` — the LLM-less host-side finalize path) renders
   the same "⚠ Deploy-ordering" section from
   `state.json.external_preconditions` via `jq`. Its output is
   byte-for-byte identical to the Python renderer's section shape
   (`- **<tag>** — <reason>`, reasons `"; "`-joined; nothing emitted
   when the field is absent or empty), so the note survives even the
   LLM-less path. No `run.json` persistence is needed —
   `external_preconditions` is already a `STATE_FIELDS` key in
   `state.json`.

#### Run-summary cost line

Both deterministic renderers also emit a `- Cost:` line in the
`## Run summary` block (after `- Workers:`), sourced from
`state.json`'s `telemetry` block: `- Cost: $X.XX (N calls, I in / O out
tokens)`. Rendered only when the telemetry block is present (omitted on
pre-classify orphans), matching the deploy-note guard. Both renderers —
`compose_pr_body` (`orchestrator/leerie.py`, `${x:,.2f}` + `,`-grouped
tokens) and the `host-finalize.sh` `jq` fallback (`money`/`group`
helpers reproducing the same 2-decimal, thousands-grouped output) — are
format-identical **except** for one residual edge: an exact half-cent
`cost_usd` (e.g. `2.675`) rounds up in `jq` (`round` is half-up) but
down in Python (IEEE-754 repr of `2.675` is `2.67499…`), a sub-cent
difference that never arises on a real summed cost. Like the deploy
note, no `run.json` persistence is needed — the `telemetry` block is a
`STATE_FIELDS` key.

**Key design note:** `reason` in `external_preconditions` is
unstructured free text (`required` is only `[tag, extent]`,
`orchestrator/leerie.py:731`). The group launcher, not the planner,
knows which sibling repos are group members — so the deploy note
identifies sibling members by injected group membership, not by
parsing planner free-text.

#### Planner steering (`prompts/planner.md`)

When a group member's planner receives a group brief (a shared context
block prepended by the launcher, marked `## Group brief` or similar),
`prompts/planner.md` contains a positive instruction directing it to:

1. **Read the sibling's contract.** Use `Read`, `Grep`, and `Glob`
   under `/inspect/<name>/` to locate and read the sibling's API
   surface, type definitions, schema, or interface files — not just
   the brief.
2. **Honor the interface.** Subtasks must conform to the sibling's
   actual types, field names, and endpoints as found in the code.
3. **Declare the dependency.** Add a `requires` entry with
   `extent: "external"` whose `reason` names the sibling repo and the
   specific contract item, for every subtask that depends on a
   sibling-owned contract.

This is advisory steering per DESIGN.md §12 ("prompts advisory, code
enforces"): the write-confinement guarantee stays code
(`filter_offtree_subtasks`), not the prompt. The instruction lifts
reliable cross-repo-aware planning from emergent (task-text-driven) to
dependable (explicit prompt rule).

The planner prompt also documents the runtime asymmetry: inspect-dir
read-only is kernel-enforced locally (`:ro` bind-mount) but
convention-enforced on Fly (`chown leerie:` in `seed-repo.sh`). The
practical guarantee is the same for planning — acting workers that get
`/inspect/` do not receive `--add-dir` on Fly either — but the
mechanism differs.

#### No new schema, state, or cap changes

This is the point of the lean shape (DESIGN.md §20 *Why the lean
shape*). The following are explicitly unchanged:

- `STATE_FIELDS` / `state.json` schema — `group_id` lives in
  `run.json` (the per-run sidecar), not in `state.json`.
- Subtask schema and planner schema — group members are ordinary runs.
- `DEFAULT_CAPS` — no new per-member cap; each member consumes from
  its own run's cap budget.
- `filter_offtree_subtasks` (DESIGN.md §12) — the existing guard
  enforces write-confinement for siblings seeded as inspect-dirs,
  unchanged.
- Branch helpers (`new-worktree.sh`, `setup-run.sh`, `integrate.sh`,
  `finalize.sh`, `host-finalize.sh`) — each member's finalize runs
  its own existing `host_finalize` against its own repo.

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §20 *Run groups (multi-repo)*.

## 3. Worker invocation contract

Each worker is one `claude -p` headless process. Flags used:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-p` | non-interactive single-shot |
| `--output-format stream-json --verbose` | streams one JSON event per stdout line as the worker runs; the final `result` event is the envelope (same shape as `--output-format json`'s single output — `cost`, `usage`, `terminal_reason`, `structured_output`). `_invoke` writes raw events to `<state-root>/logs/<sid>.log` and emits per-event inline summaries gated by `state.json["verbosity"]` |
| `--json-schema <inline>` | the payload schema; serialized inline as a JSON string — a file path is silently ignored (verified against Claude Code 2.1.143) |
| `--append-system-prompt` | injects the worker's role prompt — read from `prompts/*.md` for classifier/planner/reconciler/plan_overlap_judge/satisfied_probe/provision/implementer/integrator/conformer, plus the post-run / finalize workers pr_writer, judge, and patch_generator |
| `--allowedTools` | tool allowlist (soft — permission-tier pre-approval only); three profiles — **inspect** (`INSPECT_TOOLS`: read set + allowlisted `Bash(ls:*)` / `Bash(find:*)` / `Bash(cat:*)` / … for cross-cwd read-only inspection, **no Write/Edit**) for classifier, planner, reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, and provision; **acting** (`ACT_TOOLS`: read set + Bash/Write/Edit) for implementer, integrator, and conformer; and **base-tree-only** (`SATISFIED_PROBE_TOOLS`: read set + read-only Bash verbs + HEAD-scoped git only — `Bash(git show HEAD:*)`/`Bash(git diff:*)`/`Bash(git status)`, deliberately **no** history-spanning git) for the satisfied_probe (DESIGN §8 *Already-satisfied subtask elimination*). The acting bucket keeps Bash unrestricted because its workers run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; the inspect and satisfied-probe profiles use `Bash(<verb>:*)` prefix patterns to pre-approve specific read-only verbs at the CLI level — no Write/Edit so the prompt's "you do not modify code" rule is enforced mechanically per DESIGN §12. **Note:** `--allowedTools` is bypassed entirely by `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (it is a permission pre-approval, not a visibility restriction). The hard-deny layer below compensates |
| `--disallowedTools` | hard-deny list (`DISALLOWED_TOOLS`); removes tools from the model's context entirely — the model cannot see or call them regardless of permission mode.  Survives `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.  Denies: `Agent`, `SendMessage`, `ScheduleWakeup`, `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`, `CronList`, `RemoteTrigger`, `PushNotification` — tools that spawn untracked parallel work or set timers the orchestrator cannot track |
| `--max-turns` | per-worker turn cap (values in §6) |
| `--model` | model alias for this worker — `sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`. Value comes from per-worker resolution (see §2 *Model selection*) |
| `--add-dir` | repeated per entry in `state.json["inspect_dirs"]` (forwarded by `claude_p`'s `add_dirs` param). Used only by inspect-bucket workers (classifier, planner, reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, provision) so their sandboxed Read/Grep/Glob and allowlisted Bash verbs can reach sibling repos referenced in the task. See §2 *Inspect directories* |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | acting workers (implementer, integrator, conformer) — suppresses all permission prompts for unattended Bash and file writes. **Not** applied to inspect workers — they run in the real repo cwd (no worktree isolation), so the blast-radius assumption that justifies skip-permissions doesn't hold. The `Bash(<verb>:*)` patterns in `INSPECT_TOOLS` pre-approve listed verbs at the CLI level; anything else (e.g. `rm`, redirect-to-file) falls through and is rejected in non-interactive mode |

`claude_p()` is `async`; every caller awaits it. Internally it awaits
`_invoke()`, which spawns the worker via the `run_proc` helper
(`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` + `communicate()` with an optional timeout).
Shell scripts in `scripts/*.sh` are invoked via `run_script()`, a thin async
wrapper that resolves the script path and forwards to `run_proc`.

The validated payload is read from `structured_output` on the envelope. On a
missing or schema-invalid payload, `claude_p()` retries once with the violation
quoted into the prompt; a second failure raises `WorkerError`.

#### Auth/quota backoff

A separate retry path handles transient `claude -p` envelope errors that
indicate the Claude Code subscription is rate-limited (HTTP 401, HTTP 429),
the gateway is transiently overloaded (HTTP 529), or the result text
contains `Invalid authentication` / `rate limit` / `rate-limit`. These
need *backoff*, not the immediate corrective retry above — the gateway
has already rejected the request and a fresh request will be rejected too
until the user's rolling usage window clears (401/429) or the overload
(529) subsides. On budget exhaustion the raised `WorkerError` names the
subscription cap for 401/429/auth-text and the transient overload for
529, so the user isn't told to wait for a usage window that isn't the
actual cause.

`_is_auth_or_quota_failure` only ever consults `api_error_status` or the
result text when the envelope's own `is_error` is truthy. A successful,
schema-valid envelope never enters the backoff loop, no matter what its
`result` text says — a worker whose task legitimately discusses API auth
or rate limiting (e.g. planning a rate-limited endpoint) would otherwise
trip the text markers on its own correct output, and `claude_p()` would
burn the full backoff budget re-running an already-successful worker
before eventually raising a false subscription-cap `WorkerError`.

Because `_is_auth_or_quota_failure` requires a *result envelope*, it
cannot classify an **out-of-credits mid-stream kill** — the case where
the `claude -p` process is terminated the instant credits run out, before
a `result` event is emitted (`_invoke` returns `envelope is None`). That
truncation is caught earlier, in `_invoke` itself: as events stream, a
`nonlocal overage_blocked` flag latches when a `rate_limit_event` carries
`overageDisabledReason in {"out_of_credits", "out_of_overage"}` — an
**exhaustion** reason. In the no-envelope branch, if `overage_blocked` is
set, `_invoke` raises `RateLimitedExit(reset_at=None, out_of_credits=True,
raw)` instead of a bare `WorkerError`, routing the failure into `main()`'s
pause-and-surface arm (worktree cleanup, `--resume` hint, `EXIT_LOCKED`;
DESIGN §6). The latch does **not** key on `overageStatus == "rejected"`:
that is a standing state emitted by every `rate_limit_event` from an org
with overage disabled (`overageDisabledReason:"org_level_disabled"`,
`status:"allowed"`) and does not mean credits ran out — keying on it
misclassified unrelated mid-stream truncations as out-of-credits. The
overage event alone is *not* treated as terminal — it is a benign warning
most workers survive; only an exhaustion reason coinciding with a missing
`result` event triggers the pause. Covered by
`test_invoke_overage_block_plus_truncation_raises_ratelimited` (raises,
`out_of_credits=True`), `test_invoke_overage_block_with_result_returns_envelope`
(the benign control), and
`test_invoke_org_level_disabled_truncation_raises_workererror` (the
false-positive regression pin) in `tests/test_invoke_streaming.py`.

When `_is_auth_or_quota_failure(envelope)` matches, `claude_p()` enters a
`tenacity.AsyncRetrying` loop with `wait_exponential_jitter(initial=15,
max=120, jitter=5)` and `stop_after_delay(auth_retry_max_sec)`. Each
sleep is logged with the wait and the elapsed/total budget so the user
can Ctrl-C if they know the window won't clear in time. If the budget
is exhausted with the envelope still classified as auth/quota,
`claude_p()` raises `WorkerError` with a message naming the subscription
cap and instructing the user to re-run with `--resume` once the window
clears. If a retry returns a non-auth envelope (success or a different
error), the loop exits and normal handling resumes — a schema-invalid
non-auth envelope still gets one corrective retry under the existing
2-attempt loop.

The first tenacity iteration runs without a pre-sleep — tenacity
sleeps *between* iterations, not before the first — so the effective
sequence is one immediate retry followed by waits of roughly 15 s,
30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 120 s up to the 300 s budget. Each `_invoke`
produces one `calls.ndjson` row, so a single logical `claude_p()`
call can write up to ~7 rows when the first outer schema-loop
attempt's backoff exhausts the budget (initial `_spawn` + ~6
tenacity iterations before exhaust), and up to ~13 rows in the rare
case where the first attempt's backoff resolves to a non-auth error
and the second outer attempt also enters backoff and exhausts. The
budget resets per outer schema-loop attempt; in that rare
double-burst case, total wait can reach ~10 minutes.

The classifier and the budget constant (`auth_retry_max_sec`) live in
`leerie.py`; the budget is in §6 *Code-enforced caps*. The non-auth
`is_error` path is unchanged — schema parse failures stay immediate.

`WorkerError` handling by worker type — per DESIGN §7's salvage rule
("salvage if there is something to salvage; abort cleanly otherwise"):
- **implementer** — `run_implementer()` catches it, converts to an
  `incomplete-handoff` result; a fresh implementer continues from the checkpoint.
- **conformer** — `run_conformer()` catches it and returns `None`;
  `settle_subtask` records a `conformer crashed` entry in
  `conformance_warnings` and the subtask still returns `complete` (DESIGN §9
  *Post-work conformance*: the phase is advisory and never fails the subtask).
- **classifier, planner, reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, provision,
  integrator** — not caught locally; propagates to `main()`, which
  aborts with state saved for `--resume`.

`claude_p()` logs a non-fatal warning when the envelope `terminal_reason` is not
`"completed"` (e.g. `"max_turns"`).

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §7 (worker contract), §2 (CLI subprocess form).

## 4. Phase walkthrough (`leerie.py`)

| Phase | Function(s) | What it does |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Preflight | `preflight` | git identity, clean working tree, external `leerie` branch collision (DESIGN §3 *External collision hazard*), `claude` CLI version, live `claude -p` smoke test. Run-id collisions are detected at two points: filesystem side in `State.__init__` (the run dir is created at container start since the run-id is the container/machine ID); git side in `setup-run.sh`'s branch-creation step. `setup-run.sh` repeats the external-branch check as defense-in-depth for `--resume`. Smoke test bypassed by `--skip-smoke`; preflight skipped entirely on `--resume` |
| 1 Classify | `phase_classify` | one classifier worker → categories + questions. Returned categories are filtered against the 9-name whitelist in `CATEGORIES` (mirrors DESIGN §4); `die()` if none survive |
|   • Provision | `phase_provision` | per-repo dep **detection** (DESIGN §6½ "Worker-driven install"). Always runs; runs after classify so a docs-only run can short-circuit to `kind: none`. Five steps: `.leerie-setup.sh` hook if present → `synth_mise_go_override()` if `go.mod` lacks a `.go-version` / mise.toml go pin → `mise install` at the repo root (reads `.tool-versions` natively; `.nvmrc` / `.python-version` / `.ruby-version` / `rust-toolchain.toml` via image-set `MISE_IDIOMATIC_VERSION_FILE_ENABLE_TOOLS`) → version capture via `mise ls --current --json` → `detect_recipe_from_lockfiles()` table-first, falls back to a `provision` worker on table miss. The recipe is **persisted to `st.data["provision"]["recipe"]` and injected into implementer/conformer prompts as a `PROVISION_RECIPE:` block** — workers run install commands themselves in their own worktrees (not the orchestrator at `repo_root`, which would clobber the host's bind-mounted checkout). The synth-go-pin env var `MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES` is exported to `os.environ` so all downstream worker subprocesses inherit it. `mise install` and `.leerie-setup.sh` run through `run_streaming` so their output is visible live. Skipped on `--resume` (whole fresh-run else-branch is); the env var is re-exported from persisted state on resume. |
|   • Clarify *(optional)* | `gather_answers` | source-of-truth is satisfied non-interactively from the resolved preference (default `both`). Intent questions from the classifier are dropped by default; pass `--clarify` to surface them. With `--clarify` + interactive: collect; with `--clarify` + non-interactive: write `pending-questions.json`, exit code 10 (DESIGN §11) |
| 2 Plan | `phase_plan` | one planner worker per category, awaited concurrently via `gather_or_cancel` (a small wrapper around `asyncio.gather` defined in `leerie.py`) under an `asyncio.Semaphore(max_parallel)`; the first worker exception cancels its siblings and propagates to `main()`. After all `plan_one` results are collected, P1 Layer C runs: each first-pass subtask in each plan is expanded through `recursive_decompose(subtask, depth=0, …)` and `plan["subtasks"]` is replaced with the union of all returned leaves (DESIGN §5½ *Wire-in to phase_plan*). A plan with no subtasks is left untouched. The downstream path (reconcile → overlap_judge → schedule → validate_plan → write_plan) receives this expanded flat leaf set unchanged. |
|   • Reconcile *(when needed)* | `phase_reconcile` | compute set of `requires` capability tags with no matching `provides` across merged planner output. **Before matching, two mechanical passes run: (a) `_promote_external_collisions(plans)` rewrites any `extent: external` entry whose tag is in some plan's `provides` to `extent: in_plan` (the in-plan producer wins); (b) `_collect_external_preconditions(plans)` extracts every remaining `extent: external` entry into a deduped list `{tag, reasons[], originating_subtasks[]}` that bypasses the reconciler and is persisted by `write_plan`. Both passes are re-run after `_apply_reconciler_output` so any `extent: external` entries on reconciler-added connector subtasks also flow through the same machinery (collision-promoted if a provider now exists; otherwise added to the persisted preconditions list). The second collection idempotently replaces `st.data["external_preconditions"]` — the helper returns the full deduped set so a re-run is a refresh, not an append.** Only `extent: in_plan` entries with no matching `provides` enter the unresolved set. If empty: short-circuit (no worker spawn, plan unchanged). Else: spawn one reconciler worker that emits eight arrays — five *resolution* (renames / added_provides / added_subtasks / conditional_drops / dropped_requires), two *cycle-breaking-only* (dependency_edges / merged_subtasks; `dropped_requires` also plays a cycle-breaking role), and one *escape hatch* (unresolvable). If `unresolvable` is non-empty, dead-subtask elimination (`_prune_dead_subtasks`) first removes fully-speculative subtasks whose every `in_plan` requires is unresolvable when ≥1 domain has 0 subtasks (see "Phase 2½ checks" below); if entries remain after pruning, `die()` with the reconciler's diagnosis (DESIGN §5). Otherwise, the orchestrator applies the seven action arrays mechanically. After applying, runs an **acyclicity gate** (Tarjan's SCC over the post-mutation graph); on cycle, deep-copies the pre-mutation plans, computes a recommended cycle-resolution per SCC from structural signals, respawns the reconciler once with a structured retry prompt + bounded "must-include" set of acceptable operations, and re-runs the gate. If still cyclic, `die()` with the SCC + offending mutations enumerated. See "Phase 2½ checks" and "Cycle-resolution retry loop" below. |
|   • Overlap judge *(when 2+ planners)* | `phase_overlap_judge` | spawn one `plan_overlap_judge` worker against the reconciled plan to detect cross-planner **surface collisions** — two subtasks producing the same exported artifact (same component / function / primitive) with incompatible APIs. Schema in `SCHEMAS["plan_overlap_judge"]`. Output: zero or more `collisions`, each with `resolution ∈ {merge, drop_a, drop_b, unresolvable}` and (when `resolution=merge`) a non-empty `merge_feasibility` statement that becomes the merged subtask's unified intent. Orchestrator applies actions mechanically through `_apply_overlap_collisions` with the **anchor-survivor rule**: when one sid appears in 2+ non-`unresolvable` collisions (computed by `_compute_overlap_anchors`), it is the structural anchor of the cluster and survives every merge it participates in — overriding `_apply_overlap_merge`'s default lex-smaller rule (the default is a determinism device with no semantic content). Rationale: the anchor is by construction the broader subtask that overlaps with each partner; absorbing each partner *into* the anchor matches the judge's pairwise intent. Pairs that lack a shared endpoint use the lex-smaller default unchanged. Per-pair: `merge` → `_apply_overlap_merge` (with optional `survivor_hint=anchor_sid` when applicable; union of fields, intent concatenation, downstream `depends_on` rewrites); `drop_*` → `_apply_overlap_drop` (mirrors `conditional_drops` apply step); `unresolvable` → `die()` at plan time with both sids + artifact + judge's reason. The validator also die()s on the drop-of-anchor contradiction (a `drop_*` whose dropped sid is an anchor — judge contradicting itself by asking to delete the subtask other collisions claim absorbs them). **Per-resolution cycle avoidance:** before applying each `merge` / `drop_*`, `_apply_overlap_collisions` tentatively applies it to a copy (`_would_cycle_after`) and, if it would introduce a dependency cycle, skips it (`skipped_would_cycle`) — keeping both subtasks separate for the integrator instead of `die()`ing the run; the final post-merge Tarjan gate is retained only as a never-fires backstop. **Cheap-skip** when fewer than 2 planners produced subtasks, or total subtask count < 2 (no possible cross-planner collision). **Python backstop** asserts every `merge` carries non-empty `merge_feasibility` — caught at `_validate_overlap_judge_output` before any apply. Opt-out via `--skip-overlap-judge` (mirrors `--skip-smoke`; env `LEERIE_SKIP_OVERLAP_JUDGE`; `leerie.toml` `skip_overlap_judge`). Persists full judge output to `state.data["plan_overlap_judge"]` and post-apply mutations to `state.data["plan_overlap_applied"]` for audit. See "Phase 2¾ checks" below. |
| 3 Schedule | `detect_no_work`, `warn_cross_planner_file_overlap`, `warn_layer_gaps`, `filter_offtree_subtasks`, `filter_satisfied_subtasks`, `schedule`, `validate_plan` | **First: `detect_no_work(plans)` short-circuits when every plan has `status: "ready"` and empty `subtasks` (DESIGN §8 *The cleared-but-empty terminal state*) — `_finish_no_work_run` records `no_work_required=true` + per-domain bases in state.json, writes `finished_at` to state.json + run.json (with `no_push=True` so the host launcher does not attempt to push a non-existent branch), logs the no-work summary, and returns without scheduling. Phases 4–6 are skipped entirely.** Otherwise: warn on cross-planner file overlap; warn on layer gaps (DESIGN §5 *Migration-surface completeness* — DB-without-seed and env-provider-without-template); **soft-drop subtasks whose `files_likely_touched` resolves outside the run's repo root (most commonly into an inspect-dir mount) — recorded in `state.data["dropped_subtasks"]`**; **then `filter_satisfied_subtasks(plans, repo_root, st, caps, models, efforts)` spawns one read-only `satisfied_probe` worker per surviving subtask (bounded by `max_parallel`), each evaluating that subtask's `success_criteria_seed` against the base tree, and soft-drops those the probe marks `satisfied` — recorded in `state.data["dropped_subtasks"]` with `reason: "already_satisfied"` + the probe's evidence (DESIGN §8 *Already-satisfied subtask elimination*). Skipped when `state.data["skip_satisfied_check"]`. If this empties every `status: "ready"` plan, the gate synthesizes a `no_work_map` from the drop evidence and routes to `_finish_no_work_run` (same terminal state as native cleared-but-empty; a `status: "blocked"` plan with 0 subtasks still falls through to `schedule`'s all-blocked `die`). The probe's tool allowlist is a base-tree-only subset (NOT full `INSPECT_TOOLS`), illustratively `Bash(git show HEAD:*)`, `Bash(git diff:*)`, `Bash(git status)`, the `_READ_BASE` read set (`Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`/`WebSearch`/`WebFetch`), and read-only Bash verbs (`ls`/`cat`/`head`/`wc`/`grep`/`rg`/`file`/`stat`/`pwd`/`echo`) — but **no** `git log` / bare `git show:*` / non-HEAD ref, because a worktree shares the repo's full ref DB and history-spanning git false-positives on code present only on other branches. The exact list is `SATISFIED_PROBE_TOOLS` in `orchestrator/leerie.py`. Advisory/soft — subordinate to the `check_branch_has_commits` backstop per DESIGN §12;** merge plans, build the global DAG via `_build_predecessor_graph` (shared with the phase 2½ acyclicity gate), Kahn topological sort into waves. Cycles are expected to be caught upstream by the phase 2½ gate; if one slips through, `die()` with the full SCC report. |
| 4 Setup | `phase_execute` head → `setup-run.sh` → `capture_conformance_baseline` | create the run branch `leerie/runs/<run-id>` and its worktree (per-run, isolated from any other run). After `setup-run.sh`, `git worktree prune` clears stale `.git/worktrees/` metadata that a prior SIGKILL'd invocation may have left behind (on Fly, `machine stop` SIGKILLs the orchestrator — the `finally`-block cleanup never runs; the stale metadata persists on the volume and crashes `git worktree list --porcelain` in `new-worktree.sh` on the next resume). Then, unless `state.data["skip_base_baseline"]`, `capture_conformance_baseline(leerie_dir, st, caps)` runs once (DESIGN §9 *Base-tree health baseline*): the staging worktree is now an unmodified snapshot of the base HEAD, so it installs the persisted provision recipe into staging and runs each resolved build/lint/test command there directly via `run_streaming`, recording the exit-code verdict per axis at `st.data["conformance"]["_baseline"]`. Deterministic (no LLM); advisory (never raises — a glue error logs and proceeds with no baseline); idempotent (the `_baseline` key is the resume sentinel). A RED base logs a loud provisioning warning and writes `run.json.health.base_suite`. The baseline is threaded into every conformer prompt (`_format_baseline_section` → `BASELINE:` line) so the conformer scopes build/lint/test residuals to the delta rather than re-deriving "pre-existing" |
| 5 Execute | `phase_execute`, `settle_subtask`, `integrate_wave`, `run_final_conformance` | per wave: subtasks whose `subtask_status` is already `"complete"` are skipped (they were integrated in a prior invocation); when every subtask in a wave is already complete the wave is skipped entirely and `completed_waves` is advanced. Before dispatch, stale `subtask_status` entries for retried subtasks (failed/blocked from the prior invocation) are deleted so `_get_progress` counts them as running (absent = running per the progress-prefix convention above). Remaining implementers are awaited concurrently via `gather_or_cancel` under a fresh `asyncio.Semaphore(max_parallel)` (separate instance from Phase 2's), then integrate, then run a deterministic conflict-marker scan on the integrated worktree. `settle_subtask` runs the **post-work conformance phase** (DESIGN §9 *Post-work conformance*) on the success path before returning — `discover_rules_files` → `run_conformer` loop (≤ `conformance_rounds`) → re-run the per-subtask mechanical-precondition gates (`check_branch_has_commits`, dirty-worktree, `check_diff_scope`) against the conformer's commits → attach `conformance_warnings` to the result. The phase is advisory: residuals, build/lint/test failures, gate violations on conformer commits, and `WorkerError` all surface as warnings, never as `failed`/`blocked`. If any subtask in the wave ends `blocked` or `failed`, `phase_execute` still calls `integrate_wave` for the successful subtasks (partial-wave integration — DESIGN §3) and runs the conflict-marker scan on the staging worktree, then aborts the run — the blocker is recorded in `state.json`, the successful subtasks' work is on the run branch, and the run resumes with `--resume`. There is no LLM wave-level re-validation between waves; the §8 confidence gate is the load-bearing per-subtask signal, and `scan_conflict_markers` is the deterministic post-integration safety net. **After every wave has integrated**, `_run_phases` calls `run_final_conformance(leerie_dir, st, caps, models, efforts)` once on the staging worktree (DESIGN §6 *Worktree and integration model*, final-tree pass paragraph) — same `run_conformer` loop with `cwd = <state-root>/runs/<id>/worktrees/staging`, `DIFF_BASE = st.data["working_branch"]` (the PR's base, captured by `phase_classify`), no subtask spec / criteria inputs, same `conformance_rounds` cap, same protected-path rollback discipline. Output lands at `st.data["conformance"]["_final"] = {result, warnings}` and is threaded into the `pr_writer` payload as `final_conformance`. Advisory: any failure mode (WorkerError, malformed result, exhausted rounds) surfaces as a warning; `phase_finalize` always runs |
| 6 Finalize | `phase_finalize` → `finalize.sh`, `cleanup.sh`, post-cleanup branch verification; launcher then pushes on host | verify the run branch is non-empty; run `cleanup.sh --subtask-branches` to delete per-subtask branches; **post-cleanup branch verification** (`git show-ref --verify` on the run branch — if the branch disappeared after cleanup, `die()` routes to the pause branch to preserve the machine for recovery); record `finished_at` in `run.json`; delete the per-subtask branches `leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/*` (the run branch is **kept** as the PR head; state dir is kept as audit). **The push + PR step has moved to the host launcher** (DESIGN §6 *Finalization*). A successfully finalized run (`finished_at` set AND `current_phase` == "phase 6: finalize") is **terminal on resume** — the orchestrator returns immediately without re-executing phases 4→5→6, preventing a concurrent `decide_teardown` race. |
| Post-run Judge | `phase_judge`, `judge_capture` | standalone post-run phase (not part of main orchestrate flow): reads `calls.ndjson`, runs one `judge_capture()` per record in parallel under `asyncio.Semaphore(max_parallel)`, writes per-record verdicts to `<judge-dir>/<call_id>.json` and a summary `INDEX.json`; uses `prompts/judge.md` rubric |
| Post-run Heal | `HealState`, `heal_baseline`, `heal_apply_patch`, `heal_replay_patched`, `request_patch`, `phase_heal` | heal-loop phases: `HealState` persists failing_samples / baseline / history / best_so_far at `<heal-dir>/<call_type>/state.json`; `heal_baseline(call_type, failing_records, n, heal_dir, caps, st, models)` runs n unpatched replays per record + judge, writes baseline verdicts + state; `heal_apply_patch(call_type, iter_n, patch_text, anchor_match, heal_dir, failing_records)` materialises patched prompts under `iter-<N>/patched-prompts/`; `heal_replay_patched(call_type, iter_n, n, heal_dir, caps, st, models)` runs n patched replays per record + judge, appends iteration record to state.history; `request_patch(state, iter_n, st, caps, models)` invokes the `patch_generator` worker (schema `SCHEMAS["patch_generator"]`, SID `heal-patch-<call_type>-iter<N>`, prompt from `prompts/patch_generator.md`) and returns `(anchor, replacement)` — raises `ValueError` if the returned anchor is not a literal substring of the resolved prompt body (code-enforced per the prompts-are-advisory principle); `phase_heal(call_type, failing_records, heal_dir, caps, st, models, request_patch_fn=None, n, config)` drives the full baseline→loop→report cycle; `request_patch_fn` defaults to the real `request_patch` when `None`, or accepts a sync/async 2-arg stub for testing |

`phase_classify` runs before `gather_answers` because the question set depends
on the classification.

Between Phase 3 and Phase 4, `write_plan()` persists the merged plan
(`<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/plan.json`) and per-subtask spec files
(`<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/subtasks/<id>.json`). The conformance
phase derives its advisory build/lint/test commands separately via
`_infer_build_lint_test(repo_root)`, which performs best-effort
discovery by checking for configuration files and lockfiles. Supported
families (checked in this order; first match wins per axis via
`out[axis] = out[axis] or "..."`):

- **Makefile** → `make` (build)
- **Node/JS** (`package.json`) → `<pm> run build` (build), `<pm> run test`
  (test), where `<pm>` is detected from lockfiles: `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `pnpm`,
  `yarn.lock` → `yarn`, `bun.lockb`/`bun.lock` → `bun`, else `npm`.
  Precedence mirrors `detect_recipe_from_lockfiles()`. All PMs use the
  `<pm> run <script>` form uniformly — bun's bare `bun test` / `bun build`
  invoke built-in tools rather than package.json scripts
- **Python** (`pyproject.toml` / `pytest.ini` / `setup.cfg`) → `pytest` (test)
- **Rust** (`Cargo.toml`) → `cargo build` (build), `cargo test` (test)
- **Go** (`go.mod`) → `go build ./...` (build), `go test ./...` (test)
- **Maven** (`pom.xml`) → `mvn package` (build), `mvn test` (test)
- **Gradle** (`build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts`) → `./gradlew build` /
  `./gradlew test` when `gradlew` exists, else `gradle build` / `gradle test`
- **ESLint** (`.eslintrc.*`) → `npx eslint .` (lint)
- **Ruff** (`.ruff.toml` / `ruff.toml`) → `ruff check .` (lint)
- **RuboCop** (`.rubocop.yml` / `.rubocop.yaml`) → `bundle exec rubocop` (lint)
- **Kotlin/detekt** (`detekt.yml` / `detekt.yaml`) → `detekt` (lint) — build/test
  are already filled by the Gradle family above; detekt fills only the lint
  axis. ktlint was considered and rejected as a marker: it has no dedicated
  config file (driven by `.editorconfig` / the Gradle plugin), so it isn't
  cleanly file-detectable in this inference style.
- **C#/.NET** (`*.sln` at root, or `*.csproj` at root as fallback) →
  `dotnet build` (build), `dotnet test` (test)
- **PHP** (`phpunit.xml` / `phpunit.xml.dist`) → `vendor/bin/phpunit` (test);
  (`phpstan.neon` / `phpstan.neon.dist`) → `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` (lint)
- **Rails** — `_is_rails_repo(repo_root)` (requires both `Gemfile.lock` and
  `bin/rails` — the two-file check distinguishes Rails from
  Sinatra/Grape/etc.) → `bin/rails test` (test)

The short-circuit semantics mean earlier families take precedence: in a
polyglot Node+Rails repo, `npm run test` wins the test axis while
`bundle exec rubocop` still fills the lint axis if no ESLint/Ruff config
exists.

**Declared BLT commands (`.leerie/config.toml`).** A repo may commit
`.leerie/config.toml` with explicit `build`, `lint`, and/or `test` keys
that override the corresponding axis from inference. Missing keys fall
through to `_infer_build_lint_test()`. An empty-string value means "not
applicable" — same convention as inference — and is preserved rather than
replaced by inference. The file also accepts a `setup_packages` key
(comma-separated apt package names) that triggers per-repo Dockerfile
auto-generation (see §6½ *Auto-capture of repo dependencies*); it is
not consumed by BLT resolution.

Resolution is implemented by two functions:

- **`_load_blt_config(repo_root: Path) -> dict[str, str] | None`** — reads
  `.leerie/config.toml` via `_read_toml_key()` for each of `build`, `lint`,
  `test`, `setup_packages`. Returns `None` when the file is absent; returns a
  dict containing only the keys present in the file (no defaults for absent
  keys).

- **`resolve_blt(repo_root: Path) -> dict[str, str]`** — calls
  `_load_blt_config()`; for each axis, uses the declared value if present
  (including empty string), otherwise falls through to
  `_infer_build_lint_test()`. Logs which axes came from config vs inference.
  This is the function called by both `_run_conformance_phase` and
  `run_final_conformance` — neither calls `_infer_build_lint_test` directly.

`.leerie/config.toml` format (flat key = value, same parser as `leerie.toml`):

```toml
build = "make build"
lint  = "ruff check ."
test  = "pytest -x"
# setup_packages = "libvips-dev fonts-noto"
```

`plan.json` carries `{task, waves, subtasks, preconditions}`. The
`preconditions` array is the deduped list of `extent: external` `requires`
entries collected during phase 2½ (see DESIGN §5 `requires.extent`); each
entry is `{tag, reasons: [{sid, reason}, …], originating_subtasks: [sid, …]}`.
It is the human-facing surface for prerequisites the planners identified
but explicitly declared out-of-graph. The launcher / integrator surface
this list in the PR description so the human running the change sees what
must be true in the environment before the change is safe to ship.

## 5. Deterministic enforcement points

All in `leerie.py`, in execution order. This is the concrete catalogue behind
`DESIGN.md` §12 ("prompts advisory, code enforces").

### Preflight (before any LLM work)
| Check | Catches |
|-------|---------|
| `resolve_source_of_truth()` at startup | invalid value in `leerie.toml`, `LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH`, or `--source-of-truth` — caught before any worker spawns, not mid-planner |
| `resolve_runtime()` at startup | invalid value in `leerie.toml`, `LEERIE_RUNTIME`, or `--runtime` — caught before any worker spawns |
| `resolve_models()` at startup | invalid model alias in `leerie.toml`, any `LEERIE_MODEL[_*]` env var, or any `--model[-*]` CLI flag — caught before any worker spawns |
| `git user.email` / `user.name` set | commits would fail silently without identity |
| working tree clean | dirty tree → ambiguous diffs, corrupt merge history |
| `claude --version` ≥ `MIN_CLAUDE_CLI` (currently `(2, 1, 22)`) | CLI too old for `--json-schema` (introduced for `claude -p` in v2.1.22) — replaces the cryptic "unknown option" message a stale CLI used to produce |
| `gh auth status` + `origin` remote (launcher bash, before container) | finalize would fail at push/PR after the full run already ran. Short-circuited when `--no-push` is passed (env / TOML mirrors). |
| live `claude -p` smoke test | auth failure or network problem |

Run-id collisions are detected at two natural collision points:

| Check | Where | Catches |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `State.__init__` refuses if the run dir is locked by another process | container start | Another orchestrator already owns this `<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/` |
| `setup-run.sh` preserves an existing `leerie/runs/<run-id>` branch instead of creating it | wave-execute phase | A pre-existing branch with the same name (treated as a resume; the run picks up wherever the branch was left) |

The run-id is the container/machine ID (DESIGN §6), known at container creation time. No temporary directory or rename is needed.

`--skip-smoke` bypasses only the live smoke test (used by the test harness); the CLI version check and the `gh` check still run because they are local and read-only, and skipping them would defer a confusing failure to mid-run.

### Phase 1 checks — `phase_classify`
| Check | Catches |
|-------|---------|
| classifier-returned categories filtered against the 9-name whitelist `CATEGORIES` (mirrors DESIGN §4) | classifier hallucinating a category outside the nine |
| `die()` if no category survives the filter | a run with no valid domain for any planner |

### Phase 2½ checks — `phase_reconcile`
| Check | Catches |
|-------|---------|
| **dead-subtask elimination** (runs *before* `_check_unresolvable`) | subtasks whose *every* `in_plan` requires tag is in the reconciler's unresolvable set, when at least one domain has 0 subtasks. `_prune_dead_subtasks(plans, unresolvable_entries)` removes fully-speculative subtasks mechanically (mirrors dead code elimination after constant folding — DESIGN §5 *Dead-subtask elimination*). Prunes downstream `depends_on` references to pruned sids (same pattern as `conditional_drops`). Strips pruned entries from `output["unresolvable"]` before `_check_unresolvable` runs. If all unresolvable entries were pruned, `_check_unresolvable` returns immediately and the run proceeds. If some remain, `die()` as before. Pruned sids are recorded in `state.data["speculative_collapse_drops"]`. |
| reconciler's `unresolvable` array non-empty → `die()` with the worker's diagnosis | genuine gaps where no planner produced a needed capability *in the build graph* and no plausible connector subtask can be inferred. Restricted to `extent: in_plan` entries — `extent: external` entries are filtered out before the unresolved set is computed and surface as `preconditions` in `plan.json` rather than as failures. Each unresolved `(sid, tag)` pair is annotated with the consuming subtask's producing planner-domain (from `_compute_unresolved_requires`) so the abort message can render `domain/sid` — naming the planner-domain whose plan held the dangling dependency, which is the primary remediation lever for the user. |
| reconciler output validated against `SCHEMAS["reconciler"]` | malformed reconciler response (caught by `claude_p`'s schema gate; structurally invalid output is retried once, then escalated) |
| **size gate** on `added_subtasks` (runs *before* the acyclicity gate) | a reconciler-added subtask emitted with `size: large`. The reconciler-authored subtasks carry `_added_by_reconciler: true` (set in `_apply_reconciler_output`); `_find_oversized_added_subtasks` collects every offender. On detection, leerie tries one size-resolution retry (see "Size-resolution retry loop" below); if the retry still emits `size: large`, `die()` with the offending sids enumerated. The downstream `validate_plan` size check (line "no `size: large` subtasks" under "Plan validation") is the final backstop and only fires for planner-authored `large` after this retry exhausts; its error message names "planner" vs "reconciler" via the `_added_by_reconciler` flag so the user knows which prompt misbehaved. |
| **acyclicity gate** (Tarjan SCC over the post-mutation graph; runs *before* the unresolved-requires re-check) | a rename / added_subtask / dependency_edge that closes a dependency cycle. Each individual reconciler mutation can be locally correct yet jointly cycle-creating — e.g. two renames whose targets each provide what the other side requires. Tarjan localizes the SCC; edge attribution names which mutation closed each edge. On detection, leerie tries one cycle-resolution retry (see "Cycle-resolution retry loop" below); if the retry still cycles, `die()` with the SCC + offending mutations enumerated. |
| **must-include constraint** (apply-step enforcement on retry output) | a retried reconciler output that omits any operation from the bounded set leerie required for each named cycle. The retry prompt lists the legal operations per cycle (`dropped_requires` on either rename, `dependency_edges` in either direction, `merged_subtasks` in either direction); if the revised output doesn't include at least one for each cycle, `die()` with the missing-cycle diagnostic — surfaces "model defied a structural constraint" cleanly, never a silent cycle. |
| **unresolved-requires retry loop** (recompute unresolved set after applying reconciler output) | the reconciler's renames/added_subtasks/added_provides didn't actually close every gap. Common cause: model invented a new tag in `added_subtasks` and forgot to rename the original consumer's tag to match (captured run `075210`: `deps-008` required `cdk-stacks-authored`; reconciler created `config-011` providing `infra-stacks-authored` and never renamed deps-008's tag). On first detection, leerie tries one retry with a structured prompt that surfaces string-similarity hints from the post-mutation `provides` namespace. If the retry still leaves unresolved tags, `die()` with the structured report. |
| **unresolved-retry must-include constraint** (apply-step enforcement on retry output) | a retried output that omits any operation addressing the named unresolved entries. Legal addressing: `rename` on the (sid, tag), `added_provides` covering the tag, `added_subtask` whose provides includes the tag, `conditional_drops` on the consumer sid, `dropped_requires` on the (sid, tag) (consumer's `requires` is over-specified — an aggregate or coarser synonym of what the consumer itself provides, not a real cross-subtask dependency; the consumer stays in the plan, only the bad edge goes), or `unresolvable` on the (sid, tag). |
| **conditional_drops** apply step (DESIGN §5 resolution action) | a planner-emitted consumer subtask whose own `intent` declares it conditional on an unresolvable `extent: in_plan` precondition (signals like "no-op if X", "conditionally add", "drop if Y", "otherwise this subtask is dropped"). The apply step removes the named sid from its plan, prunes downstream `depends_on` references to that sid, and records the drop in `state.data["conditional_drops"]` (keyed by sid → `{reason, from_unresolved_tag}`). Distinct from `state.data["dropped_subtasks"]`, which records off-tree soft-drops from `filter_offtree_subtasks` (phase 3) — same shape of audit signal, different cause. The apply step `die()`s if the target sid carries `_added_by_reconciler: true` (the op is restricted to planner-authored consumers — a reconciler-added subtask has no planner prose to convert into a structured drop). |
| **dropped_requires** apply step (DESIGN §5 resolution action — also a cycle-breaking op) | a consumer's `requires` entry that was over-specified by its planner — an aggregate, coarser synonym, or authoring-time decision the same subtask itself records, rather than a code artifact another subtask produces. The apply step removes the named `(sid, tag)` `extent: in_plan` entry from the consumer's `requires` list. The consumer itself stays in the plan (unlike `conditional_drops`, which removes the whole subtask) — only the bad edge goes. Apply mechanics are identical whether the op is emitted as a resolution (unresolved-tag retry, addressing an over-specified self-reference) or a cycle-breaker (the over-specified entry was what closed the cycle). Silent no-op on missing sid/entry, mirroring `renames`. |
| post-unresolved-retry cycle gate re-run | the retry's revised output reintroduces a cycle (e.g., a rename closes a loop). Same Tarjan check as the primary acyclicity gate; on cycle, `die()` with the SCC report. |

**Size-resolution retry loop.** When the size gate fires on the first
reconciler attempt (any `added_subtask` with `size: large`), `phase_reconcile`
deep-copies the pre-mutation plans, reverts the failed mutations, builds a
retry prompt (in `_build_size_retry_prompt`) that names each offending sid,
its `provides`/`requires`/`depends_on`, and the explicit decomposition rule
("emit one subtask per `provides` tag, or smaller groupings that share state"),
then respawns the reconciler worker once with that prompt. Maximum two
attempts total — mirrors the cycle-retry shape. Cost: one extra reconciler
spawn on oversize runs only; non-oversize runs pay nothing extra.

No recommendation heuristic is computed (unlike the cycle loop): the
mechanical guarantee is "split it into N subtasks each providing one
`provides` tag," which is rendered directly into the retry prompt. The
reconciler's prompt (`prompts/reconciler.md`) also documents the rule on
first attempt; the retry is the enforcement.

The size gate runs *before* the acyclicity gate because oversize
authoring is an upstream defect: a `large` subtask bundling four
capabilities is also more likely to produce a cycle than four small
single-capability subtasks. Splitting first lets the cycle gate evaluate
the cleaner graph.

**Retry composition (snapshot refresh).** When multiple retries fire on
the same run (e.g., size retry succeeds and then the cycle gate fires),
each successful retry refreshes `pre_plans_snapshot` to the post-retry
state. The next retry's revert therefore restores the most recent good
state, not the original pre-mutation state. Without this refresh, a
cycle retry firing after a successful size retry would undo the size
split — the oversized subtask would return and reach `validate_plan`,
producing a misleading "size-retry exhausted" error even though the
size retry actually succeeded. The unresolved retry doesn't refresh
because it's the last gate before `phase_reconcile` returns.

**Cycle-resolution retry loop.** When the acyclicity gate fires on the first
reconciler attempt, `phase_reconcile` deep-copies the pre-mutation plans,
reverts the failed mutations, computes a *recommended* operation per SCC
from structural signals (in `_recommend_cycle_resolution`), builds a
retry prompt (in `_build_cycle_retry_prompt`) that names the SCC, the
mutations that closed each edge, the structural signals, the
recommendation, and the bounded "must-include" set of acceptable
operations, then respawns the reconciler worker once with that prompt.
Maximum two attempts total — mirrors the schema-fail retry shape at
`leerie.py: claude_p()`. Cost: one extra reconciler spawn (~$1–2, ~1 min)
on cycling runs only; non-cycling runs pay nothing extra.

The recommendation heuristic is deterministic:

1. **Exactly one edge in the SCC is a planner-declared `depends_on`** →
   recommend `dropped_requires` on the rename that closes the reverse
   direction. (Planner ordering wins; the reconciler's rename is the drift.)
2. **Else SCC members share `files_likely_touched`** → recommend
   `merged_subtasks(into, from)` where `into` is the smaller subtask by
   `success_criteria_seed` length (tie-break: lexicographic sid). The
   subtasks are authoring the same file; one commit will do both pieces of
   work; the shorter-criterion subtask becomes the canonical home.
3. **Else** → recommend `dropped_requires` on the rename whose `from` tag
   had no planner-declared producer in the pre-reconcile graph. (The
   rename was speculative — the tag was never going to resolve to a real
   producer; dropping the requirement is structurally honest.)
4. **Tie-breaker of last resort** → drop the lexicographically later rename.

The retry prompt presents the recommendation as the answer (not as one of
several options) and explicitly forbids `unresolvable` for cycle
resolution — the model must commit to one of the bounded operations or
echo the recommendation. The mechanical floor (gate + must-include) is
the guarantee; the recommendation primes the model toward the
structurally-correct answer.

**Unresolved-requires retry loop.** Symmetric architecture to the
cycle-resolution loop, fired by a different gate. When the post-mutation
`_compute_unresolved_requires` set is non-empty (after the cycle gate
has already cleared), `phase_reconcile` deep-copies the pre-mutation
plans, computes a string-similarity recommendation per unresolved entry
(in `_recommend_unresolved_resolution`), builds a retry prompt (in
`_build_unresolved_retry_prompt`) that surfaces the unresolved
`(sid, tag)` pairs, the top-3 candidate `provides` ranked by Jaccard,
the recommendation (if computed), and the bounded must-include set,
then respawns the reconciler once. Maximum two attempts total; cost
mirrors the cycle retry.

The recommendation heuristic is deterministic but framed as a *hint*
(not the answer) because the underlying signal is textual string
similarity — which can produce false friends (a textually-close-but-
semantically-distinct synonym). Two guards filter candidates before
scoring: a **self-loop guard** skips candidates whose provider includes
the consumer's own sid (would create a self-edge), and an
**extent-aware** guard ensures only `extent: in_plan` entries are
considered. Cases (first match after guards wins):

1. **Unique top match with Jaccard ≥ 0.5** → recommend
   `rename(sid, from=tag, to=top.tag)`. (Verified on captured run
   075210: fires correctly with `j=0.5` for `cdk-stacks-authored` →
   `infra-stacks-authored`.)
2. **Top match with Jaccard ≥ 0.7 (even if not unique)** → same.
3. **Else** → no recommendation; model picks unaided (the common case
   per historical scan; ~88% of post-mutation unresolved entries lack
   a strong-similarity candidate).

`unresolvable` IS valid for this retry (unlike the cycle retry's
strict forbid) — if no real producer exists for the tag, surfacing
that cleanly is the right answer. The mechanical floor (must-include
validator + post-retry unresolved + cycle re-check) catches every
malformed revision; the recommendation is best-effort.

### Phase 2¾ checks — `phase_overlap_judge`
| Check | Catches |
|-------|---------|
| **cheap-skip when impossible** (fewer than 2 planners contributed subtasks, OR total subtask count < 2) | spurious worker spawn on single-planner / trivial runs. No `plan_overlap_judge` call in `calls.ndjson`; log line `phase 2¾: overlap-judge skipped (single planner)` or `… (< 2 subtasks)` at normal verbosity. |
| judge output validated against `SCHEMAS["plan_overlap_judge"]` | malformed judge response (caught by `claude_p`'s schema gate; structurally invalid output retried once, then escalated per the standard policy). |
| **merge-feasibility backstop** (`_validate_overlap_judge_output`) — every collision with `resolution == "merge"` must carry non-empty `merge_feasibility` | the judge skipping the merge-feasibility discipline section in `prompts/plan_overlap_judge.md`. Per `DESIGN.md §12` (prompts advisory, code enforces): the prompt asks for `merge_feasibility` whenever `merge` is emitted, and Python rejects a `merge` without it. `die()` with the offending pair (`a_sid`/`b_sid`/`artifact`). |
| **`merge` apply step** (`_apply_overlap_merge`) | collapse the two subtasks: surviving sid is the lexicographically smaller id by default (a determinism device — same merged plan regardless of pair argument order) OR the value of the optional `survivor_hint` parameter when the caller is applying the anchor-survivor rule for a cluster. Surviving subtask gets the union of `files_likely_touched`, `provides`, `requires`, `depends_on` (with self-references removed); `title` becomes `"{survivor.title} + {dropped.title}"`; `intent` is the concatenation of the survivor's existing intent, the absorbed subtask's full existing intent (under a `--- Absorbed intent from {dropped.id} ---` marker), and a trailing `"Merged with {dropped.id} by plan-overlap-judge:\n{judge.merge_feasibility}"` note. Carrying the absorbed subtask's intent is required by the DESIGN §5 *merge_feasibility carry-forward* invariant: any merge_feasibility statement previously appended to the absorbed subtask's intent (from an earlier merge where it was a survivor) must be preserved. `success_criteria_seed` becomes `"{survivor.criteria} AND {dropped.criteria}"`. Downstream subtasks whose `depends_on` referenced the dropped sid are rewritten to point at the surviving sid. Records the mutation in `state.data["plan_overlap_applied"]`. |
| **`drop_a` / `drop_b` apply step** (`_apply_overlap_drop`) | remove the dropped sid; union the dropped subtask's `provides` tags into the survivor's `provides` (deduped, order-preserving — without this union, any downstream `requires` that matched the dropped subtask's tags would orphan into a confusing `validate_plan` error rather than resolving cleanly against the survivor); drop any survivor `extent: in_plan` requires whose tag is now in the post-union provides (would-be graph self-loop, mirrors `_apply_overlap_merge`); rewrite downstream `depends_on` references from the dropped sid to the survivor. Title / intent / success_criteria_seed are NOT copied from the dropped subtask — the judge said one intent supersedes the other, so the survivor's intent is the intent that wins; only the capability-graph wiring is unioned. |
| **anchor-survivor rule** (`_apply_overlap_collisions` + `_compute_overlap_anchors`) — pairwise collisions resolve into a coherent cluster decision | shared-endpoint clusters where one subtask appears in 2+ non-`unresolvable` collisions (an *anchor*, e.g. judge emits both `merge(A, B)` and `merge(A, C)` because A overlaps with B on one artifact and with C on another). The anchor is structurally the broader subtask that overlaps with each partner; the apply loop passes `survivor_hint=anchor_sid` into `_apply_overlap_merge` when exactly one of the pair's endpoints is in the anchor set, so the anchor survives that merge (overriding the default lex-smaller rule, which is a determinism device with no semantic content). When both endpoints are anchors — legitimate within a single connected cluster, e.g. the closing edge of a triangle — the rule falls through to lex-smaller; the merged subtask still carries forward every prior `merge_feasibility` via the absorbed-intent block (DESIGN §5 carry-forward invariant). A `survivor_of: dict[str, str]` map rewrites later pairs against earlier survivors so a partner already absorbed into the anchor isn't looked up as a stale endpoint. Pairs whose endpoints have both rewritten to the same survivor (the redundant closing edge of a connected cluster) are recorded as `skipped_redundant` entries in `state.data["plan_overlap_applied"]` so the audit trail reflects every collision the judge emitted. The pairwise judge protocol stays simple; cluster decisions are enforced in code, not in the prompt (DESIGN §12). `_apply_overlap_drop` has a `dropped_sid == surviving_sid` self-loop guard as defense in depth against future callers reaching it with a self-collapsed pair. |
| **anchor consistency gate** (`_validate_overlap_judge_output`) — drop-of-anchor contradiction die()s before any mutation | a `drop_*` whose `dropped_sid` is an anchor — the judge is asking to delete the same subtask other collisions claim absorbs them, directly self-contradictory. die() with the anchor sid, the partner sid, the artifact, and the suggested resolution (refine task or downgrade to `unresolvable`). (Earlier iterations also gated `merge`-between-two-anchors, but the apply loop's natural semantics — fall-through to lex-smaller with absorbed-intent carry-forward — handles every observed multi-anchor shape cleanly, so the check was removed as over-aggressive.) |
| **`unresolvable` → `die()`** at plan time | genuine API contradictions the judge correctly refuses to silently auto-merge. The abort message names both sids, the colliding artifact, the judge's reason, and the suggested next step (revise the task or manually delete one of the colliding subtask specs and `--resume`). Strictly better than the multi-hour wave-N integrator design-conflict crash this phase exists to prevent. |
| **per-resolution cycle avoidance** (`_would_cycle_after` inside `_apply_overlap_collisions`) — checked before each `merge` / `drop_a` / `drop_b` apply | a collision resolution's dependency-union (survivor inherits the absorbed subtask's `provides`/`requires`/`depends_on` plus downstream `depends_on` rewrites) can introduce a transitive cycle absent from the post-reconcile graph (phase 2½'s acyclicity gate passed before these resolutions ran). Before applying each resolution, `_would_cycle_after(plans, apply_fn)` deep-copies `plans`, applies the resolution to the copy, rebuilds the predecessor graph via `_build_predecessor_graph`, and runs `_tarjan_sccs`. If the resolution *would* cycle, it is skipped (`skipped_would_cycle`; see next row) and both subtasks are kept separate for the integrator. The check is side-effect-free (operates on the copy) and runs against the *current live* `plans` so it sees every earlier-applied resolution. Covers `drop_*` too, because `_apply_overlap_drop` also unions `provides` and rewrites `depends_on`. |
| **post-merge acyclicity backstop** — Tarjan SCC on the final post-merge graph, immediately after `_apply_overlap_collisions` returns | with per-resolution avoidance above in place, this gate must never fire. It rebuilds the predecessor graph via `_build_predecessor_graph`, runs `_tarjan_sccs`, and on a surviving cycle `die()`s with `_format_cycle_diagnostic` output — but framed as an **orchestrator logic bug** (the tentative check and the real apply path disagreed), *not* a user-recoverable condition (per-resolution skipping already exhausted the `--skip-overlap-judge` lever). Retained as defense-in-depth against future drift between `_would_cycle_after` and the real apply, mirroring `_apply_overlap_merge`'s defensive missing-sid `die()`. |
| **`skipped_would_cycle` audit action** (`_apply_overlap_collisions`) | a `merge` / `drop_*` whose apply would close a dependency cycle. Recorded in `state.data["plan_overlap_applied"]` as `{"action": "skipped_would_cycle", …}` with both sids, the artifact, and `resolution`; logged at normal verbosity. Crucially, `survivor_of` is **not** updated on a skip — both endpoints stay live, so later collisions referencing either endpoint resolve against a present sid (mirrors how a merge would otherwise repoint them). The judge is not re-prompted; the cycle is a global-graph property outside its pairwise-surface competence (DESIGN §5 *Cross-domain surface overlap* → *Post-merge acyclicity*). |
| **state persistence** | full judge output written to `state.data["plan_overlap_judge"]` (for audit / replay); post-apply mutation summary written to `state.data["plan_overlap_applied"]`. Persisted before `phase_overlap_judge` returns; visible in `state.json` for resume-time replay debugging. |

The judge's empirical recall on the test corpus (5 runs / 38 subtasks)
was 100% — every observed surface collision was flagged including the
`0c4bab` AuthShell pair that motivated this phase, with the merge-
feasibility discipline correctly downgrading the AuthShell case to
`drop_a` (legitimate plan-time resolution) rather than `merge` (the
v1-prompt failure mode that would have produced a frankenstein
implementer spec).

The complementary `warn_cross_planner_file_overlap()` check at phase 3
is **kept as-is** — it now serves as a complementary signal for file-
overlap that *doesn't* indicate surface collision (the deliberately-
permissive same-file-different-surface class).

### Plan validation — `validate_plan` (after scheduling, before persisting the plan)
| Check | Catches |
|-------|---------|
| **budget feasibility** — `check_budget_feasibility()` runs at the same layer as `validate_plan`, immediately after `schedule()` returns and before `write_plan()` persists. Estimates remaining `claude -p` calls (implementers + conformers + integrators per wave + finalize) added to `worker_count` already spent on upstream phases, multiplied by `budget_safety_margin`, compared to `max_total_workers`. | a planner output that is mathematically too large to fit the configured `--max-workers` cap. The pre-existing runtime backstop is `State.bump_workers()` which raises `WorkerError` partway through execution; this earlier check `die()`s with `EXIT_BUDGET_INFEASIBLE=11` and a recommended `--max-workers` value at the cheapest possible moment (no implementer has spawned yet, only the integrated commits from upstream judgment phases are sunk). Opt-out via `--skip-budget-check` / `LEERIE_SKIP_BUDGET_CHECK` / `leerie.toml`. See §"Budget feasibility preflight" above and DESIGN §13 *Budget feasibility — fail fast at the cheapest moment*. |
| ids match domain prefix (`bugfix-`, `feat-`, `refactor-`, `perf-`, `test-`, `deps-`, `config-`, `docs-`) | cross-domain collisions, audit ambiguity. The planner's user prompt receives the prefix directly as `ID_PREFIX = CATEGORY_ABBREV[domain] + "-"`, so the prompt cannot drift from the validator's allowlist — both derive from the same `CATEGORY_ABBREV` map (in `leerie.py`). |
| no `size: large` subtasks | planner OR reconciler violated the sizing constraint. The error message names the actual author via the `_added_by_reconciler` flag — "planner must split it further" for planner-authored, "reconciler must split it further (size-retry exhausted)" for reconciler-added subtasks that survived the size-resolution retry loop. The reconciler path is exercised through the phase 2½ size gate first; this row is the post-merge backstop for the planner case and the exhaustion case. |
| no empty `success_criteria_seed` | implementer has no criteria starting point |
| every `depends_on` id exists | dangling edges silently dropped by the scheduler |
| every `requires` entry is an object `{tag, extent, reason?}`; `extent ∈ {in_plan, external}`; `reason` non-empty when `extent: external` | malformed planner output (caught at JSON-schema validation in `claude_p`; this row is the post-merge defensive re-check) |
| every `requires` entry with `extent: in_plan` has a provider in some subtask's `provides` | unresolvable cross-domain dependency (only `in_plan` is checked; `external` entries are explicitly out-of-graph by planner declaration) |
| no `files_likely_touched` entry matches `is_protected_path()` (`.leerie/`, `.git/`, or top-level `.claude/` outside the deliverable subtrees) | planner named a protected meta-directory as an implementer deliverable — the implementer would either fail `check_diff_scope` mid-run or work around the gitignore and still be rejected. Catching this at plan-validation time gives the planner a corrective-retry round instead of burning an implementer invocation. For coordination artifacts (research specs, design summaries) the planner should use `provides`/`depends_on` and the implementer's `artifacts` result field — see DESIGN §5 *Artifact passing between subtasks* — not `files_likely_touched`. |

`warn_cross_planner_file_overlap()` runs immediately after
`phase_reconcile` (before `validate_plan` and the scheduler) and **logs a
warning, never fails**, when two planners' subtasks both list the same
path in `files_likely_touched`. Empirically (May 2026, n=3 historical
runs) failed runs had ≥9 cross-planner overlaps each while the
successful run had zero; the warning surfaces that risk at plan time.
The reconciler now consumes the same shared-files signal as one input to
the recommendation heuristic (above) when a cycle requires resolution
— SCC members that share `files_likely_touched` get a `merged_subtasks`
recommendation. The warning itself remains as runtime visibility for the
user; it complements the recommendation heuristic rather than replacing
it.

`warn_layer_gaps(plans)` runs at the same layer and surfaces two
heuristic warnings (DESIGN §5 *Migration-surface completeness*):
(1) any subtask's `files_likely_touched` includes a `schema.prisma`
path but no subtask across the full plan touches seed or migration
files — database-initialization gap; (2) any subtask's `provides`
tags contain env/bootstrap/secret/credential keywords but no subtask
touches `.env.example` or env documentation — env-contract gap.

`filter_offtree_subtasks()` runs at the same layer (after
`warn_cross_planner_file_overlap`, before `schedule()`) and **soft-drops
any subtask whose `files_likely_touched` contains a path that does not
resolve under the run's primary repo root** — the common case is a leak
into an inspect-dir mount (`/inspect/<repo>/...`), where the planner
named a file the implementer cannot modify because the mount is
read-only. Drops are recorded in `state.data["dropped_subtasks"]` and
logged per-subtask. The drop must run before `schedule()` because
`phase_execute` iterates `state.data["waves"]` (not the in-memory
`subtasks` dict), and `waves` is computed by `schedule()` — a drop
after that point leaves `waves` referencing a sid with no spec on disk.
A soft drop is the right shape because a `die()` here is unrecoverable:
the resume branch in `_run_phases` does not re-run the planner pipeline
and requires `state.data["waves"]` (only written by `write_plan` after
this point). When a dropped subtask provides a tag a survivor requires,
`validate_plan`'s existing unresolvable-requires check (above) catches
it and dies with `<sid>: requires '<tag>' but nothing provides it —
dependency is unresolvable and will be silently dropped` — the user
sees both messages and re-frames the task.

### Per-subtask checks — in `settle_subtask`, every worker result
| Check | Catches | On failure |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `validate_result()` — `incomplete-handoff` with missing checkpoint file | session-limit no-op; `--max-turns` with no checkpoint written | **Retryable** (`failure_kind="empty_handoff"`) |
| `validate_result()` — other cross-field invariants | `handoff` with null `checkpoint_path`; `blocked` with no blocker; `failed` with no summary; `needs-clarification` with no `clarification_question` / invalid `checkpoint_path` | **Terminal** (`failure_kind="broken"`) |
| `check_branch_has_commits()` | `complete` claim, nothing committed *and* no `artifacts` returned. A non-empty `artifacts` array on the result is a substitute deliverable (DESIGN §5 *Artifact passing between subtasks*) — research-style subtasks whose only output is structured data for downstream subtasks pass this gate without commits. | **Retryable** |
| dirty worktree check | uncommitted changes that vanish on integration | **Retryable** |
| `check_diff_scope()` | `.leerie/` or `.git/` in the diff; any `.claude/` path *except* `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/` (the documented Claude Code user-deliverable subtrees — implementers may write a subagent/command/skill file there as a legitimate deliverable, but never `settings.json` or any top-level `.claude/` file) | **Terminal** (protected path); scope-volume warning is non-fatal (triggered when `files_likely_touched` is non-empty *and* touched > max(3× expected, 5), or when touched > 15 regardless of the planner's estimate) |
| `validate_checkpoint()` — on `incomplete-handoff` | required section missing; required section empty/whitespace; required section contains only a placeholder token (`none`/`n/a`/`na`/`tbd`/`nothing`/`unknown`/`todo`/`pending`/`—`/`--`/`-`/`?`, trailing `.`/`!`/`?`/`…` ignored and repeated `?` collapsed); a path listed under `## Files touched` no longer exists in the worktree and is not flagged `[deleted]` | returns `blocked` |
| `_retryable_failure(kind)` — on `status='failed'` returned by the worker itself | worker self-report of failure | routed through the retry policy with `failure_kind="broken"` (worker self-report has no producer to tag a more specific kind, and a self-reported failure is broken-worker territory by default); **terminal** on first occurrence |

`validate_result()` accepts a `complete` status regardless of what
`criteria_results` carries — empty, missing, or with `met:false`
entries are all valid. Per DESIGN §8 the criteria file is
informational, not a gate. A worker's unmet-criterion self-report is
recorded on the result for telemetry and surfaces as a warning in
`state.json["conformance"]` alongside the conformance-phase residuals,
but does not affect the subtask's terminal status. The criteria-file
lock (`lock_criteria` / `verify_criteria_lock`) and the
worker-initiated `criteria_revision_proposal` channel were both removed
when the criteria file's load-bearing role retired — see DESIGN §9.

### Per-subtask post-work conformance — in `settle_subtask`, success path only

Triggered only when an implementer's `status: "complete"` has already cleared
every check above (commits present, worktree clean, no protected path
written). None of the other terminal statuses (`incomplete-handoff`,
`needs-clarification`, `blocked`, `failed`) invoke the conformer.
Implements DESIGN §9 *Post-work conformance*.

| Step | Function | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| Discover rules files | `discover_rules_files(repo_root)` | Returns existing paths from a fixed, capped allowlist (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agent.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/STYLE.md`, `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/UI.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`), deterministic order, never raises. Empty list when nothing matches. The design-system candidates (`docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` and spelling variants) exist so a repo's component/color/banner conventions reach both the conformer and the implementer (DESIGN §9). |
| Run conformer | `run_conformer()` | One `claude -p` invocation with `ACT_TOOLS`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `SCHEMAS["conformer"]`. Accepts optional `extra_feedback: str \| None` — when non-None, appended to the user prompt (used for Pattern B backgrounding-retry feedback from prior round). Catches `WorkerError` and returns `None` (surfaced as a warning). |
| Validate output | `validate_conformance_result()` | Cross-field invariants — `rule_violations_residual` non-empty requires `rules_files_read` non-empty; each `rule_violations_fixed` item must cite a non-empty `rule` string; each `docs_updates` / `tests_updates` item must cite a `path` that exists. On failure → warning, loop breaks. |
| Re-run gates | `check_branch_has_commits`, dirty-worktree check, `check_diff_scope` | Same functions used on the implementer, re-applied to any new commits the conformer added. A scope-protected-path violation triggers `rollback_conformer_commits()` (reset to `before_sha`) and is recorded as a warning, **not** as `failed` / `blocked`. |
| Loop bound | `caps["conformance_rounds"]` (default 3) | Re-runs the conformer if its output is malformed or residuals remain. Exhausting the cap with residuals still present is a warning, not a failure. |
| BLT-axis observability + feedback | `_emit_bash_axis_warnings()` | After each round, parses the per-worker JSONL log at `<state-root>/runs/<id>/logs/<sid>-conformer.log` (or `final-conformer-r<N>.log` for the final pass) and surfaces two types: (1) **multi-invocation** (advisory only) — `conformer round N: ran <AXIS>_CMD K times in one round` — legitimate progressive testing (targeted → full suite → grep) is the common cause; surfaced for observability. (2) **retry-after-backgrounded** (feedback-injected) — `conformer round N: <AXIS>_CMD auto-backgrounded (bash_id=<id>) and was followed by another <AXIS>_CMD invocation` — the "retry-instead-of-recover" pattern. These Pattern B warnings are collected after each round and, if non-empty, formatted via `_format_check_feedback()` and passed as `extra_feedback` to the next round's `run_conformer()` call so the conformer can correct the behavior. Helpers `_count_bash_axis_invocations()` and `_count_orphaned_bg_axis()` are pure log-parsing — never raise. `_BLT_AXIS_RES` is a `dict[str, re.Pattern[str]]` containing compiled regexes for the test, build, and lint axes: test matches `pnpm/npm/yarn/bun/npx test` (and `vitest`), `vitest run`, `bin/rails test`; build matches `pnpm/npm/yarn/bun build`, `tsc`, `next build`; lint matches `pnpm/npm/yarn/bun lint`, `biome check`, `eslint`, `rubocop`. The `_count_orphaned_bg_axis` detection logic also accepts `BashOutput shell_id=<id>` polls as a valid recovery path — forward-compatible with future tool-surface changes. |
| Attach result | — | `res["conformance"]` (worker output blob) and `res["conformance_warnings"]` (list of strings) are added to the implementer's result. The subtask still returns `complete`. |

The phase is advisory: **no path through the conformance phase produces a
`failed` or `blocked` subtask status.** Build/lint/test failures, malformed
conformer output, conformer crashes, gate violations on conformer commits,
and exhausted rounds all surface as entries in `conformance_warnings` and as
non-fatal log lines. This is the §12 enforcement boundary for the phase:
*discovery* of rule files, *schema validity* of the conformer's output, and
the *protected-path invariance* across conformer commits are code-enforced;
whether the conformer made the right docs/tests/rule-violation calls is left
to the worker and not second-guessed.

### Wave-level checks (after integration)
| Check | Catches |
|-------|---------|
| `scan_conflict_markers()` | unresolved `<<<<<<<` markers in the run-branch worktree after integration — deterministic safety net |

There is no LLM wave-level re-validation. An earlier version of
`validate_wave` ran a deterministic test-runner fast-path and an LLM
validator over per-subtask criteria, with a re-spawn loop bounded by
`wave_revalidation_rounds`; all of that was removed when the criteria
file's load-bearing role retired (DESIGN §8, §9). Per-subtask quality
is the implementer's confidence gate; the wave-level safety net is the
deterministic conflict-marker scan.

### Post-integrator checks (after an integrator handles a conflict)
These verify the integrator honored DESIGN §6's *behavioral* conflict-
resolution contract — the integrator prompt itself
(`prompts/integrator.md`) carries the behavioral spec (read every
involved subtask's intent, preserve each side's intent, call
irreconcilable cases a `design-conflict`); the orchestrator only checks
the outcome.

| Check | Catches |
|-------|---------|
| `check_merge_committed()` | integrator returned `resolved` but left the worktree mid-merge (`MERGE_HEAD` present) or with staged-uncommitted changes — **terminal**: merge aborted, run stops |
| `check_integrator_commit()` | integrator merge commit touched `.leerie/` files — non-fatal warning, recorded to `state.json` |
| integrator status `design-conflict` / `failed` | unresolvable conflict — **terminal**: in-progress merge aborted, the run branch left clean at the last good wave, diagnosis saved, run stops |

### Resume integrity — `validate_resume_state()`
Enforces (one half of) DESIGN §6's "the run branch is the resume contract"
invariant — state.json's `waves`/`completed_waves` say *which* wave to
resume; the never-reset `leerie/runs/<run-id>` branch holds *the work*
every prior wave produced. Both must be coherent for resume to be safe.

On `--resume`: asserts `task` is present and non-empty; asserts `waves`,
`completed_waves`, `subtask_status` are well-formed *if present*. `waves` is
intentionally optional — a run interrupted before scheduling has none, and
`main()` handles that case with a clearer message. Rejects corrupt or
hand-edited state without rejecting a legitimately-early interruption.

The `except SystemExit` handler in `main()` guards `st.save()` behind
`st.data.get("task")` so that a failed `--resume` (which `die()`s before
state was loaded) does not poison the host-side `state.json` with a bare
`{"finished_at": …}` stub — that would block subsequent resume attempts
with "no usable task" instead of the clearer "no state.json".

`orchestrate()` also re-resolves the source-of-truth preference on every
`--resume` and overwrites `state.json`'s `source_of_truth_pref` with the
fresh value, so a change to `leerie.toml` or `LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH`
between runs takes effect on resume.

Per-worker models are likewise re-resolved on every `--resume` from the
current CLI flags, env, and `leerie.toml`. They are *not* persisted in
`state.json` (they are startup config, not run state), so a change to
`LEERIE_MODEL`, `--model`, or the per-worker overrides between runs
takes effect immediately on resume.

### Concurrency model
The orchestrator runs on a single `asyncio` event loop. Each `claude -p`
worker is spawned via `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` (wrapped by the
`run_proc` helper) and awaited; both spawn sites pass
`start_new_session=True` so each worker becomes its own POSIX session and
process-group leader (PGID == PID), isolating it from the orchestrator's
own group. Parallel workers within a wave run concurrently via
`gather_or_cancel` — a small `asyncio.gather` wrapper that, on the first
exception, cancels every other in-flight task and awaits its finalization
before re-raising — under an `asyncio.Semaphore` bounded by
`max_parallel`. Because every mutator runs on the single loop, `State`
carries no lock — coroutines only interleave at `await` points, which
never fall inside a `st.data[k] = v; st.save()` pair. `State.save()`
still writes to a temp file then `os.replace()` for atomicity against
process crash.

Subprocess cleanup is three-layered, addressing two distinct leak classes plus mid-run pressure reduction:

1. **Lifetime descendant tracking (`_DescendantTracker`).** A per-worker
   asyncio task started at spawn polls `_enumerate_descendants(proc.pid)`
   every ~0.5s and accumulates every PID ever observed as a descendant
   of the worker. On every exit path — success AND failure — the
   tracker's `stop_and_reap()` SIGKILLs the accumulated set. This is
   the load-bearing fix for Claude Code's Bash tool with
   `run_in_background: true`: the tool wrapper spawns its user command
   in a detached POSIX session, then the wrapper itself can exit while
   the user command keeps running. By the time `claude -p` exits, the
   backgrounded command has been reparented to PID 1 and is no longer
   reachable via post-hoc PPID walk from the worker — but the tracker
   observed it mid-flight and has its PID. Without lifetime tracking,
   the descendant is invisible to cleanup.

2. **Abnormal-exit subtree termination (`_terminate_proc_tree`).** On
   `KeyboardInterrupt`, `SIGTERM`, `RateLimitedExit`, or any other
   `BaseException`, `run_proc`'s and `_invoke`'s catch-all handlers
   call `_terminate_proc_tree(proc)`. The helper sends SIGTERM to the
   worker's process group (`os.killpg`) AND to every descendant
   currently reachable via PPID walk (`_enumerate_descendants`), waits
   `_PROC_TREE_GRACE_SEC = 2.0` for graceful shutdown, then SIGKILLs
   the survivors via the same two mechanisms. The PPID walk is needed
   because Claude Code's Bash tool subprocesses are in a *different*
   POSIX session than `claude -p` — `killpg(claude_p_pgid)` does not
   reach them, so the walk is the only way to enumerate them while
   the parent chain is still intact. Exception paths run the tracker
   reap *after* `_terminate_proc_tree`, catching any backgrounded
   subprocess that was orphaned during the run.

Layers 1 and 2 compose: `_terminate_proc_tree` is broad and
synchronous (one call, kills attached subtree), the tracker is narrow
and historical (kills only what it observed, including processes
that have since reparented away). Neither alone is sufficient; both
together close the leak.

3. **Mid-run PID reaping (`_poll_loop` + `_reparented_orphans`).** A
   pressure-gated reducer that sits under the PID-exhaustion-detection
   backstop (see below) and proactively reaps orphaned subprocesses before
   `pids.max` is reached. `_DescendantTracker` gains a `cgroup_sid: str | None = None`
   parameter (default `None` so existing direct constructors in the test
   suite keep working and the reaper is inert without a cgroup). `_invoke`
   threads the in-scope `cgroup_sid` into the constructor call. Each
   `_poll_loop` cycle, when `cgroup_sid` is set, the tracker calls
   `_cgroup_stat(cgroup_sid)` and computes the pressure ratio
   `pids.current / pids.max`. Reaping is armed only when that ratio reaches
   or exceeds `_PID_REAP_HIGH_WATER = 0.90`; when armed, it calls
   `_reparented_orphans(self._seen)` to obtain the killable set and sends
   `SIGKILL` oldest-first (via the existing `_signal_pids`), stopping as
   soon as the ratio drops below `_PID_REAP_LOW_WATER = 0.75`. Killed PIDs
   are pruned from `_seen`; the exit-time `stop_and_reap` path is unchanged.
   `_reparented_orphans(seen: set[int]) -> list[int]` runs one
   `ps -eo pid,ppid,etimes` snapshot and returns, sorted oldest-first, the
   PIDs from `seen` that are simultaneously alive, reparented to init
   (`ppid == 1`), and at least `_PID_REAP_MIN_AGE_SEC = 60` seconds old.
   Module-level constants (placed next to `_DESCENDANT_POLL_SEC` /
   `_PID_EXHAUSTION_WINDOW`): `_PID_REAP_HIGH_WATER = 0.90`,
   `_PID_REAP_LOW_WATER = 0.75`, `_PID_REAP_MIN_AGE_SEC = 60`.

4. **Zombie reaping (`_become_subreaper` + `_zombie_reaper`).** The reaper
   above handles *live* leaked processes; **zombies** (`<defunct>` tasks not
   yet `wait()`ed) also count against the cgroup `pids.max`, and the container
   PID 1 (`runuser` locally / idle `sleep infinity` on Fly) is not a reaping
   init, so orphaned `git`/`ssh-agent` descendants reparent to it and rot
   (DESIGN §6 *Zombie reaping*). `_become_subreaper()` — called once early in
   `main()` before any worker spawns — issues
   `ctypes.CDLL(None).prctl(_PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER=36, 1, 0, 0, 0)` so
   orphaned descendants reparent to the orchestrator; Linux-guarded
   (`sys.platform`), a logged no-op elsewhere; returns `bool`. `_zombie_reaper()`
   is a background asyncio task spawned in `orchestrate()` next to `sampler_task`
   and cancelled in the same `finally` — mirroring `_memory_sampler`'s lifecycle.
   It is **targeted, not `waitpid(-1)`**: `_orphan_zombie_children()` scans
   `/proc` for this process's own zombie children (`state == Z`,
   `PPid == getpid()`) not in `_ASYNCIO_MANAGED_PIDS`, and the reaper
   `os.waitpid(pid, WNOHANG)`s each individually (~1 s; `ChildProcessError`/
   `OSError` benign). A blanket `waitpid(-1)` would race asyncio's child watcher
   and steal a live worker's exit status (→ returncode 255 + warning); the
   targeted scan never touches an asyncio-awaited PID. `_invoke` adds `proc.pid`
   to `_ASYNCIO_MANAGED_PIDS` at spawn and `discard`s it in its `finally`.
   `_signal_pids` deliberately does NOT `waitpid` (it only SIGKILLs); the central
   `_zombie_reaper` is the single reaping point. Because orphans now reparent to
   the orchestrator (not PID 1), `_reparented_orphans` accepts
   `ppid in (1, os.getpid())`. `_PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER = 37` exists for the test
   read-back.

**PID-exhaustion detection (`_cgroup_stat` + `_read_stream` probe).** The
above cleanup runs at worker *exit*; leaked `run_in_background`
subprocesses accumulate against the worker cgroup's `pids.max` (default
`worker_pids_max = 1024`, resolved by `resolve_worker_pids_max`:
`--worker-pids-max` > `LEERIE_WORKER_PIDS_MAX` > `worker_pids_max` in
`leerie.toml` > `DEFAULT_CAPS["worker_pids_max"]`) *during* the run.
Once the cap is hit every
`fork()` in the subtree returns `EAGAIN`, so every `Bash` tool-call fails
(in-process tools are unaffected) and the worker spirals without
diagnosing the cause (DESIGN §6 *Detecting PID exhaustion*). The broker
gains a read-only `stat <sid>` verb → `OK <pids.current> <pids.max>
<pids.events.max>` (or `ERR <msg>`); its client is
`_cgroup_stat(sid) -> tuple[int,int,int] | None` (None when the broker is
down or containment is off). `_read_stream` keeps a bounded
`deque(maxlen=_PID_EXHAUSTION_WINDOW)` of recent tool-result outcomes
(True=errored) via `_tool_result_outcome(event)` — which returns None for
non-tool-result events (assistant/system/rate_limit) so they are skipped,
NOT counted as resets. When the window holds `≥_PID_EXHAUSTION_ERROR_THRESHOLD`
(3) errors **and the latest result is itself an error** (so the synchronous
broker probe is not re-issued on the interleaved successes of a
healthy-but-failing worker), it calls `_cgroup_stat`, and if `current >= max` or
`pids.events.max` is climbing it `log()`s the cause, relabels the inline
`tool-fail` summary (`_summarize_stream_event`) to name the PID cap, and
raises `WorkerError` — which the existing `except BaseException` in
`_invoke` turns into a `_terminate_proc_tree` + tracker-reap, routing to
the callers' normal handling (implementer → retryable `incomplete-handoff`;
conformer → advisory `None`). `_is_fork_exhaustion(text)` is a cheap
fast-path that also matches the `EAGAIN` string when it survives into the
tool-result, but the cgroup probe is authoritative. A window (not a
*consecutive* counter) is required because tool-results are never adjacent
in the stream — the model's assistant turn always sits between them — so a
consecutive counter could never exceed one. The window still leaves an
ordinary failing test (≤1 error) well below the threshold.

### Abnormal exit and rate-limit contract (DESIGN §6 *Cleanup on abnormal exit*)

All abnormal exits — Ctrl-C, SIGTERM/SIGHUP, WorkerError, unhandled
exception, or `RateLimitedExit` — route through
`_cleanup_on_abnormal_exit(st, full_purge=False)`. **State.json, the
run branch, per-subtask branches, and implementer checkpoints all
survive**; only worktrees are removed (and re-created idempotently on
`--resume` via `scripts/new-worktree.sh`).

Per-worktree removal has a 240s timeout — calibrated against a real
868 MB / 41k-file worktree (npm install + Next.js build) which takes
~45-90s uncontested, with several-fold growth under N-way concurrent
disk contention. Per-worktree failures (timeout or OS error) are
non-fatal and counted; if any failed, the cleanup emits one closing
log line pointing the user at `scripts/cleanup.sh --run-id <id>` to
finish manually. The pass is best-effort: a stale worktree on disk is
the worst case, not a corrupted run.

Per-worker `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` from `_invoke` (raised when the
worker hits `worker_timeout_sec`, default 5400s / 90 min) is caught
by both `run_implementer` (returns an `incomplete-handoff` envelope,
matching the WorkerError handoff path so settle_subtask's existing
machinery handles it) and `run_conformer` (logs + returns None,
matching the WorkerError advisory-phase semantics). Without these
catches the timeout escapes through the asyncio cancellation chain
into `main()`'s catch-all and dumps a multi-KB traceback — including
the entire `claude -p` command line — to the user's terminal.

`RateLimitedExit` is raised by `detect_session_limit(text)` inside
`_summarize_stream_event` when a worker stream contains the verbatim
Claude Code subscription message
`"You've hit your session limit · resets <h>:<mm><am|pm> (<IANA TZ>)"`,
or by the same function's `rate_limit_event` branch when the
protocol-level event's `status` field falls outside the known-allowed
set `{"allowed", "allowed_warning"}` — a defensive match against
future terminal status strings (Anthropic's terminal value, e.g.
"exceeded" / "denied" / "blocked", is internal and unobserved by us;
matching everything-not-allowed avoids hardcoding a guess that could
go stale). The protocol-level path parses `resetsAt` (a Unix timestamp
in seconds) into a UTC `reset_at`; the text path parses the wall-clock
time + IANA tz. A **third** raise site lives outside `_summarize_stream_event`: the
`_invoke` no-result-envelope branch. When a worker stream truncates
with no `result` event *and* the account hit credit exhaustion (a
`rate_limit_event` seen mid-stream with `overageDisabledReason in
{"out_of_credits", "out_of_overage"}`, latched into a `nonlocal
overage_blocked`), `_invoke` raises `RateLimitedExit(reset_at=None,
out_of_credits=True, raw)` instead of a bare `WorkerError` — the
out-of-credits-mid-stream-kill case described under §3 *Auth/quota
backoff*. It is deliberately raised here, not in `_summarize_stream_event`,
because the latch must survive to the post-stream no-envelope check even
at quiet verbosity (where the summarizer returns `None`). The latch keys
on `overageDisabledReason`, **not** on `overageStatus == "rejected"`:
the latter is a standing state emitted by every `rate_limit_event` from
an org with overage disabled (`overageDisabledReason:
"org_level_disabled"`, `status:"allowed"`) and is *not* exhaustion —
keying on it misclassified unrelated truncations as out-of-credits. An
`org_level_disabled` truncation therefore takes the ordinary
`WorkerError` path.

Either source produces a `reset_at: datetime | None`
(parse failure → `None`, never a wrong-time guess) and the raw
message. `main()`'s `except RateLimitedExit` arm: when `reset_at` is
set, run worktree cleanup, sleep until the moment + 30s margin, then
`os.execv(sys.executable, [sys.executable, __file__, "--resume",
"--run-id", <id>])` to re-exec the orchestrator itself (NOT the
launcher — the launcher is not baked into the container image and
its `--resume` path would attempt to spawn a new container; the
orchestrator already runs inside the container with state on disk
and accepts `--resume --run-id`). The `--max-workers` budget is NOT
reset across the re-exec: `worker_count` persists in state.json,
so a run that repeatedly hits the rate-limit still respects the
user's cap;
when `reset_at` is None because of an unparseable session-limit
message, sleep a fixed `RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC` (300 s) and
re-exec `--resume` the same way — we can't compute a wake time, so we
poll; a premature retry re-hits the same clean pause. Both of these
(clock-based) arms route through the shared `_sleep_then_reexec(st,
wait_seconds, reason) -> int | None` helper (cleanup → sleep →
`os.execv`). It returns `None` when the `os.execv` succeeds (the process
is replaced, so the return is unreachable), and an **exit code** when
the sleep or re-exec was interrupted/failed instead: `130` on Ctrl-C
(SIGINT), `128 + signum` on SIGTERM/SIGHUP (143 / 129, matching main()'s
top-level signal arm), and `EXIT_LOCKED` (75) on the should-never-happen
`os.execv` failure. The caller does `rc = _sleep_then_reexec(...); if rc
is not None: exit_code = rc` and leaves `abnormal = False` (the helper
already ran cleanup, so the `finally` must not re-run it).

The `out_of_credits=True` arm does **not** auto-resume: out-of-credits
has no reset clock (it clears only on a top-up / billing cycle), so
`main()` runs `_cleanup_on_abnormal_exit(st, full_purge=False)`
directly, logs a `leerie --resume <id>` hint, sets `exit_code =
EXIT_LOCKED` and `abnormal = False`, and falls through to the `finally`
(which must not re-run cleanup). This is checked *before* the
`reset_at` branch. `_sleep_then_reexec` is never called for this case.
The old `reset_at=None → exit 75 manual-resume` behavior is gone for
rate-limits (they auto-resume), but out-of-credits deliberately
preserves the surface-and-pause semantics for the reason above.

**Auto-resume override persistence.** The re-exec passes only
`--resume <id>` as argv — any CLI overrides on the original
launch (`--model`, `--max-workers`, `--max-parallel`, `--confidence-rounds`,
`--source-of-truth`, `--clarify`, `--no-push`) are **not** propagated
to the fresh process. They fall back to env vars (`LEERIE_*`) and
`leerie.toml` settings, which are re-resolved on every `--resume`
(see "Resume integrity" above). Users who rely on a non-default
setting should configure it via env or `leerie.toml` rather than a
single CLI flag, so an auto-resume preserves it. A manual `--resume`
(invoked by the user after they Ctrl-C the auto-resume wait, or after
the rare interrupt/execv-failure exit) can re-supply CLI overrides as
needed.

Ctrl-C (SIGINT) is **resumable** — same contract as every other
abnormal exit. The explicit "throw this away" gesture is
`scripts/cleanup.sh --run-id <id> --branches`, not Ctrl-C. This was a
behavior change from earlier versions of leerie where Ctrl-C ran a full
purge; the old design conflated user intent ("stop this run") with
run lifecycle ("nuke the artifacts").

## 5½. Mechanical-feedback loops (CRITIC pattern)

Every worker except the PR writer runs inside `_run_checked_loop` — a
generic async function that calls the worker, runs deterministic
structural checks on the output, and re-invokes with formatted
feedback if issues are found. The pattern is grounded in the CRITIC
framework (ICLR 2024): self-correction works only with external
tool-verified feedback, not intrinsic self-review.

### Core functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `_run_checked_loop(invoke, check, name, max_rounds, make_feedback_prompt)` | Generic loop: call → check → feedback → retry. Returns `(result, warnings)`. |
| `_confidence_axes_clear(conf, axes, threshold)` | Pure predicate: True when every named axis in `conf` is a number ≥ threshold. Used by the loop and by `settle_subtask`'s implementer confidence check. |
| `_format_check_feedback(issues, rnd, max_rounds)` | Formats issue list into the structured feedback block injected on re-invocation. |
| `_confidence_schema(axes)` | DRY helper: builds the §8 confidence sub-schema for the given score axes. Used by all 10 worker schemas (including `fit_judge` and `splitter`). |

### Per-worker mechanical checks

Each returns `list[str]` — empty when clean. Pure Python, no LLM.

| Worker | Check function | Issue codes | Max rounds cap |
|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Classifier | `check_classifier_output(result, repo_root)` | `CATEGORY_NO_DIR`, `EMPTY_WHY`, `MANY_CATEGORIES`, `SAME_WORK_RISK`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `judgment_check_rounds` (3) |
| Planner | `check_planner_output(result, repo_root, domain)` | `PHANTOM_PATH`, `DANGLING_DEP`, `EMPTY_CRITERIA`, `OVERSIZED`, `INTRA_DOMAIN_OVERLAP`, `PROTECTED_PATH`, `INTRA_DOMAIN_CYCLE`, `UNCOVERED_MIGRATION_SURFACE`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `planner_check_rounds` (3) |
| Reconciler | `check_reconciler_output(output, plans)` | `RENAME_TO_NOWHERE`, `BAD_PREFIX`, `SELF_DEP`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `judgment_check_rounds` (3) |
| Overlap judge | `check_overlap_judge_output(output, plans, repo_root)` | `PHANTOM_ARTIFACT`, `NO_FILE_OVERLAP`, `DROP_BREAKS_GRAPH`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `judgment_check_rounds` (3) |
| Provision | `check_provision_output(result, repo_root)` | `WRONG_PM`, `MISSING_WORKDIR`, `EMPTY_RECIPE`, `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `judgment_check_rounds` (3) |
| Implementer | `check_implementer_output(result, subtask, actual_files)` | `NO_PLANNED_FILES_TOUCHED`, `UNMET_CRITERION` | `implementer_confidence_retries` (2) |
| Integrator | `check_integrator_output(result)` | `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `judgment_check_rounds` (3) |
| Conformer | (unchanged: `_conformance_clean` on observable signals) | — | `conformance_rounds` (3) |

`LOW_CONFIDENCE` is emitted by `_confidence_issues(conf, axes, threshold=9.0)`,
a helper that returns one issue string per axis below threshold. Each check
function calls it with its worker's schema-defined axes: classifier
`["classification"]`, planner `["task_understanding", "decomposition_quality"]`,
reconciler `["reconciliation"]`, overlap judge `["judgment"]`, provision
`["recipe_correctness"]`, integrator `["resolution"]`.

The reconciler's size-gate and cycle-gate retry paths also run
`check_reconciler_output` after each retry's `_apply_reconciler_output`,
logging warnings for any structural issues.

### Task-referenced file extraction

When the task string references files (detected by
`glob_task_references`), the orchestrator extracts structural elements
and injects them as an external coverage checklist into the planner's
prompt. This is a novel technique inspired by but distinct from the
executable-specification architecture of arxiv 2603.25773 (see
DESIGN.md §8 for the distinction).

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `_expand_braces(pattern)` | Pre-expands `{a,b}` brace groups that Python's `glob.glob` does not handle. Recursive for nested braces. |
| `glob_task_references(task, repo_root)` | Scans the task string for file-path tokens, expands braces, globs each pattern. Returns deduplicated `list[Path]`. |
| `extract_task_file_structure(task, repo_root)` | Extracts H3+ headings from `.md`/`.txt` (regex: `#{3,6}`; H1/H2 skipped as structural), numbered items (excluding TOC anchor links `[...](#...)`), list-item IDs from `.yaml`/`.yml` (regex: `^- id:`), and top-level mapping keys. Stdlib-only (no PyYAML). Returns `list[str]` or `None`. |
| `check_task_file_coverage(extracted, subtasks)` | Checks which extracted items are not referenced by any subtask. Returns `LOW_COVERAGE` issue when >50% uncovered AND item count ≤ `_MAX_COVERAGE_ITEMS` (50). Above the cap, returns empty (too dilute for meaningful gating). |
| `_format_task_file_structure(items)` | Formats extracted items as a prompt section for the planner. |
| `_MAX_COVERAGE_ITEMS` | 50. A planner with 5–15 subtasks can realistically cover ~50 items; above this the 50% threshold becomes unrealistic. |

No-op when the task doesn't reference files.

### P6 repo-map — `build_repo_map` + `rank_repo_map`

Implements DESIGN §5½ (P6) *Codebase structural map*. Both functions are
deterministic, lazy-import tree-sitter (so the module loads on a bare host
Python that lacks the package), and call no LLM.

| Symbol | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `_repo_map_cache_key(path)` | Returns `"<abs_path>@<mtime_ns>"` — a stable cache key that changes when a file is touched. |
| `_walk_calls(node)` | Walks a tree-sitter CST recursively, collecting bare-name identifiers from `call` expression function positions. Returns `list[str]`. Attribute callees (e.g. `obj.method`) are skipped — only bare-name callees become ref edges. |
| `_parse_repo_file(path)` | Parses one source file with `tree_sitter_language_pack.process()` (for defs/structure) and a tree-sitter CST walk (for call-site refs). Returns `(defs: list[str], refs: list[str])`. Returns `([], [])` on unsupported language or any error (graceful degrade). |
| `build_repo_map(repo_root, leerie_root)` | Walks all source files under `repo_root` (skipping `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, etc.), parses each with `_parse_repo_file`, and builds `{"files": {rel_path: [def_sym, ...]}, "refs": {def_sym: {rel_path, ...}}}`. mtime-caches per-file parse results under `<leerie_root>/<REPO_MAP_CACHE_DIR>/<sha256(abs_path)>.pkl` — only files whose `mtime_ns` changed since the last call are re-parsed (Aider diskcache pattern). Cache dir created on first use. Always returns a valid dict; never raises. **Silent-degrade visibility (DESIGN §12):** if the repo contains source files (by extension, `_SOURCE_EXTS`) but the graph comes back empty, `_warn_repo_map_empty_once()` runs a functional probe (`_tree_sitter_extraction_works()` — parses a known snippet via `_parse_repo_file`) and emits exactly one warning per process **only if the probe confirms tree-sitter cannot extract symbols** (unavailable or API-incompatible → P6 silently a no-op). A genuinely non-code repo (no source files) or a working parser on a legitimately symbol-less repo stays quiet — no false positives. |
| `_pagerank(graph, personalization, damping, max_iter, tol)` | Personalized PageRank on a directed `dict[str, set[str]]` graph. Pure stdlib (no networkx). Handles dangling nodes (no out-edges) via a dangling-mass redistribution term. Converges when sum of per-node rank deltas < `tol`. Returns `dict[str, float]` (node → rank score). |
| `_render_repo_map_subgraph(repo_map, ranked_files, max_files)` | Renders the top `max_files` files from `ranked_files` as a compact text block: one line per file listing its defined symbols (`path: Sym1, Sym2, ...`). Files with no defs are omitted. |
| `_count_tokens_approx(text)` | Approximate token count: `max(1, len(text.encode()) // 4)` — ~4 bytes per token (GPT/Claude typical). Used by `rank_repo_map`'s binary-search budget fit. |
| `rank_repo_map(repo_map, seed_files, seed_symbols, token_budget)` | Builds a file→file edge graph via shared symbols (definer → referencing files), runs personalized PageRank biased toward `seed_files` and files that define/reference `seed_symbols`, then binary-searches the largest prefix of the ranked-file list that fits within `token_budget` tokens (default `DEFAULT_CAPS["repo_map_tokens"]`). Returns the ranked subgraph as a plain text string. Returns `""` when the map is empty. |

**Edge direction:** `build_repo_map` tracks `refs[sym] = {files that call sym}`. `rank_repo_map` builds a file→file edge from the definer of `sym` to each file that references it — so widely-referenced utility files accumulate high in-degree and surface as structural backbone.

**Personalization in `rank_repo_map`:** seed files get weight 1.0; files defining a seed symbol get 1.0; files *referencing* a seed symbol get 0.5. When no seed resolves to a known file, uniform personalization is used (scores all files equally, falling back to link structure only).

**Skip flag:** `resolve_skip_repo_map` (see §2 "Skip flags") gates the call; when `True`, `build_repo_map` is not called and the planner degrades to the prior grep/glob-only path.

### Phantom-path check

`PHANTOM_PATH` fires when a `files_likely_touched` entry does not exist
and no ancestor directory between the file and `repo_root` exists
either.  This catches hallucinated paths (e.g.
`src/totally/invented/dir/file.ts` when `src/totally/` does not exist)
while tolerating greenfield features that create new subdirectories
under an existing parent (e.g. `src/components/features/social/post.tsx`
when `src/components/features/` already exists).

### Migration-surface check

`check_planner_output` includes an `UNCOVERED_MIGRATION_SURFACE` check
(DESIGN §5 *Migration-surface completeness*). For each subtask whose
`intent` or `investigation_notes` matches a migration-signal regex
(phrases like "replaces direct `X`", "extract `X` as", "migrate from
`X`"), the check greps `repo_root` for the old-pattern string `X`,
collects files containing it, cross-references against
`files_likely_touched` across all subtasks in the domain, and emits the
issue when > 5 files are uncovered. The threshold avoids false positives
from comments, type definitions, and test fixtures. The CRITIC loop
feeds the issue back as structured feedback; multi-sample selection
deprioritizes samples that miss the migration surface.

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `_MIGRATION_SIGNAL_RE` | Compiled regex matching migration-signal phrases in subtask text |
| `_MIGRATION_SURFACE_THRESHOLD` | 5 — uncovered file count below which the check stays silent |
| `_grep_old_pattern(pattern, repo_root)` | `subprocess.run` grep for the pattern; returns set of file paths |

### Multi-sample planning

When `planner_samples > 1`, `phase_plan` runs N independent
`plan_one(category, sample_idx)` calls per domain in parallel
(bounded by `max_parallel`). Each gets a unique `sid`
(`planner-{category}-s{idx}`) so log files don't collide.

`_select_best_planner_sample(samples, repo_root, domain)` mechanically
selects the winner: fewest `check_planner_output` issues, tiebreak on
subtask count (more = better coverage), tiebreak on first sample
(determinism). No LLM merge judge — avoids self-bias. A crashed sample
(worker returned `None`) is dropped from the candidate set before
selection. If all samples for a domain crash, the run aborts.

### Cap resolvers

Same resolution pattern as existing resolvers (CLI → env → TOML →
default): `resolve_judgment_check_rounds`,
`resolve_planner_check_rounds`,
`resolve_implementer_confidence_retries`, `resolve_planner_samples`.
Env vars: `LEERIE_JUDGMENT_CHECK_ROUNDS`,
`LEERIE_PLANNER_CHECK_ROUNDS`,
`LEERIE_IMPLEMENTER_CONFIDENCE_RETRIES`, `LEERIE_PLANNER_SAMPLES`.

## 6. Caps and their values

Defaults in `DEFAULT_CAPS` and the per-worker `claude_p` call sites.

### Code-enforced caps (the orchestrator counts these)
| Loop | Cap | On cap |
|------|-----|--------|
| subtask continuations (re-spawns of an implementer for the same subtask — both context-exhaustion handoffs *and* mid-execution clarifications consume from the same budget) | 3 (`subtask_continuations`) | return `blocked`; fatal at wave boundary |
| corrective retries of a *retryable* failure per subtask (`failed_retries`) | 1 | return `failed` |
| orchestrator-level conformer rounds per subtask (`conformance_rounds`) | 3 | exit the conformance loop; any residuals become `conformance_warnings` on the subtask result — never `failed` / `blocked` (DESIGN §9 *Post-work conformance*). Backgrounding-retry (Pattern B) warnings from round N are injected as structured CRITIC-pattern feedback into round N+1. |
| total worker invocations per run | 200 (`--max-workers`, also `LEERIE_MAX_WORKERS` env or `max_workers` in `leerie.toml`) | the cheap, runtime backstop in `State.bump_workers()`: raises `WorkerError`, abort, state saved for `--resume`. The complementary early check is `check_budget_feasibility()` at the plan/execute boundary (after `schedule()`, before `write_plan()`) — it estimates remaining `claude -p` calls from the planner output and `die()`s with `EXIT_BUDGET_INFEASIBLE=11` and a recommended `--max-workers` value before any implementer spawns, so a run that is mathematically unwinnable fails at the cheapest moment rather than mid-wave. See DESIGN §13 *Budget feasibility — fail fast at the cheapest moment* and §"Budget feasibility preflight" above. |
| per-subtask call-estimate (for the feasibility preflight) | 2.5 (`subtask_call_estimate`) | not a runtime gate; consumed by `check_budget_feasibility()` as the per-subtask multiplier in its remaining-call estimate. Default calibrated from successful runs at 2.0–2.31; the safety margin (next row) absorbs the lint-fighting inflator that pushes the ratio above 2.5 on environments-heavy repos. |
| budget-preflight safety margin | 1.15 (`budget_safety_margin`) | not a runtime gate; consumed by `check_budget_feasibility()` as the multiplier on `total_estimate` before comparison to `max_total_workers`. With the default `subtask_call_estimate=2.5`, the guaranteed cap headroom is ~1.44×. |
| concurrent workers within a wave | 5 (`--max-parallel`, also `LEERIE_MAX_PARALLEL` env or `max_parallel` in `leerie.toml`) | throughput throttle. Per-worker cgroup memory containment (see row below) keeps an OOM inside one worker's cgroup, so the wave-level parallelism can be high without risking cascade to sshd / lima-guestagent. Users on smaller VMs can opt down via `--max-parallel`. |
| turns per `claude -p` call | per worker (below) | worker stops; implementer → `incomplete-handoff` |
| per-worker wall-clock (`worker_timeout_sec`) | 5400 s (90 min) | worker killed; implementer → `incomplete-handoff` |
| per-worker idle-event warning (`worker_idle_warn_sec`) | 300 s (5 min) | log a `no stdout events in <gap>s` warning naming the worker, its PID, and any stderr tail. Observation-only — the worker is NOT killed; `worker_timeout_sec` remains the only kill. Surfaces silent-hang failures (a worker that never emits its first `system/init` event) so the user is not left with zero feedback between phase start and the 90-min hard kill. |
| per-worker cgroup memory cap (`worker_memory_max_bytes`) | auto-derived from `/proc/meminfo` (VM ram split across `max_parallel + 1` slots, clamped to ≤ 4 GiB), or `--worker-memory-max SIZE` / `LEERIE_WORKER_MEMORY_MAX` / `worker_memory_max` in `leerie.toml`. Suffixes K/M/G/T accepted | the kernel OOM-kills inside the worker's cgroup; sibling workers, the orchestrator, and host-side services (sshd, lima-guestagent) are not eligible victims. Enforcement goes through the **cgroup broker** (`scripts/cgroup-broker.py`), which the dropped-privilege orchestrator drives over a Unix socket — worker enrollment and limit-setting cannot be done from the orchestrator's own identity (a subtree merely `chown`ed after creation keeps its controller limit files root-owned; cross-scope migration needs common-ancestor write; both reproduced). The broker creates `<V2_ROOT>/leerie.slice/leerie-w-<sid>` (cgroup **v2** — `V2_ROOT` is the literal `/sys/fs/cgroup` rootful/Fly, or the systemd-delegated user slice under rootless containerd via `LEERIE_CGROUP_V2_ROOT`, DESIGN §6 *Rootless exception*) or the split `pids/`+`memory/` hierarchies at the fixed `V1_ROOT` (cgroup **v1/hybrid**, e.g. some Fly VMs, never rootless) and sets its `memory.max`. Local nerdctl needs the launcher's cgroup bind-mount — `bind-propagation=rshared` rootful, a plain bind (no propagation flag) rootless — + `--cgroupns=host` (default `--cgroupns=private` + `nsdelegate` blocks migration even for the broker); Fly's microVM exposes cgroupfs directly. `_cgroup_probe` asks the broker to round-trip a create+enroll+destroy — the true test of the worker path — and `enforce_and_record_cgroup_containment` `die()`s before the first worker if it fails (unless `--dangerously-allow-uncapped`). See DESIGN §6 *Memory containment*. |
| per-worker cgroup PIDs cap (`worker_pids_max`) | 1024, or `--worker-pids-max N` / `LEERIE_WORKER_PIDS_MAX` / `worker_pids_max` in `leerie.toml` (positive integer; `resolve_worker_pids_max` `die()`s on bad input) | kernel rejects further `fork()` from any process in the worker cgroup once the count is reached. Catches runaway fork-bomb behavior in tool subtrees while still admitting a legitimate heavy conformance run (a subprocess-heavy full test suite bursts past a too-low cap in seconds — faster than the mid-run reaper's 60 s min-age gate). Raise it per-repo for suites heavier than the 1024 default. |
| aggregate container memory cap (`leerie.slice/memory.max`) | auto-derived in `scripts/container-entry.sh` (PID 1) from VM `MemTotal` in `/proc/meminfo`: `MemTotal - max(1 GiB, 12.5%)`, reserving headroom for PID 1 + VM daemons (sshd, lima-guestagent, containerd). Overridable via `LEERIE_CONTAINER_MEMORY_MAX_BYTES` (raw bytes); `0`/`max` opts out. **Intentional provenance deviation:** unlike the per-worker cap, there is *no* CLI flag / `leerie.toml` key / `DEFAULT_CAPS` entry — the cap is applied by the shell entrypoint *before* the Python orchestrator (and its resolver machinery) starts, so a Python-side resolver could not set it in time; the env var is the single override knob. Best-effort: any read/write failure leaves the slice uncapped (prior behavior). Sets `memory.max` (RAM) only, not `memory.swap.max` — a capped slice may swap before the cgroup OOM fires, which still contains the pressure to the slice (no global OOM); bounding total RAM+swap via `memory.swap.max` is a possible future refinement. | when the slice's aggregate RSS exceeds the cap the kernel triggers a *cgroup-scoped* OOM (`CONSTRAINT_MEMCG`) that kills a process *inside the container* (per-worker `-998` protection is only relative within the slice), instead of a VM-wide *global* OOM that would kill unprotected host-session processes — the `nerdctl` client especially — and orphan the container (wedging the run-dir flock). See DESIGN §6 *container boundary's hidden precondition*. |
| auth/quota backoff budget (`auth_retry_max_sec`) | 300 s (5 min) | `claude_p()` retries the worker with `tenacity` exponential backoff (initial 15 s, max 120 s, ±5 s jitter) on 401/429/529/auth-message envelopes. Budget exhausted → `WorkerError` naming the subscription cap (401/429/auth-text) or the transient overload (529). See §3 *Auth/quota backoff*. |
| mechanical-feedback rounds for judgment workers (`judgment_check_rounds`) | 3 | classifier, reconciler, provision, overlap judge, integrator. The orchestrator runs deterministic checks (file existence, graph cycles, lockfile consistency) on each worker's output and re-invokes with structured feedback if issues are found. On exhaustion, proceed with best result + warnings. CRITIC pattern (ICLR 2024). |
| mechanical-feedback rounds for planner (`planner_check_rounds`) | 3 | Same CRITIC pattern, but higher default because the planner has richer checks (phantom paths, dangling deps, intra-domain cycles, protected paths, task-file coverage). |
| implementer confidence retries (`implementer_confidence_retries`) | 2 | Separate from `subtask_continuations`. Orchestrator checks confidence scores + scope drift + unmet criteria on complete results and re-invokes as a continuation if issues found. |
| planner samples (`planner_samples`) | 3 | Independent parallel invocations per domain. Mechanical selection: fewest issues, tiebreak on subtask count. Set to 1 to disable. Also `LEERIE_PLANNER_SAMPLES` env or `planner_samples` in `leerie.toml`. CLI: `--planner-samples`. |
| P6 repo-map token budget (`repo_map_tokens`) | 1000 | Token budget for the personalized-PageRank-ranked subgraph injected into the planner/splitter (DESIGN §5½ (P6) *Codebase structural map*). The subgraph is binary-searched to fit within this many tokens. Not user-tunable via CLI / env / toml — internal to `build_repo_map()` / `rank_repo_map()`. |
| P1 recursive decompose max depth (`decompose_max_depth`) | 5 | Maximum recursion depth for `recursive_decompose()` (DESIGN §5½ (P1) *Recursive judge + splitter*). Recursion terminates at depth ≥ 5 even if `fit_judge` still scores below `decompose_fit_threshold`. A depth-5 tree can represent up to 32 leaves from one subtask. Not user-tunable via CLI / env / toml. |
| P1 fit-judge pass threshold (`decompose_fit_threshold`) | 0.70 | `fit_judge` confidence score at or above which a subtask is accepted as a leaf (well-fit). MEASURED on n=24 telemetry-labeled subtasks: oversized mean 0.26 vs well-fit mean 0.84 — 0.57 separation, 88% accuracy at 0.70. Not user-tunable via CLI / env / toml. |
| P1 no-progress guard (`decompose_noprogress_rounds`) | 2 | Consecutive recursion rounds that produce no child with a fit score above the parent's before the subtask is accepted as a leaf with a warning. Prevents a degenerate splitter from looping to `decompose_max_depth`. Not user-tunable via CLI / env / toml. |

### P1 recursive decomposition surface (DESIGN §5½ (P1))

`partition_files(files: list[str], chunk_size: int) -> list[list[str]]`
Deterministic chunker for the migration-sweep path. Splits `files` into
non-overlapping chunks of at most `chunk_size` (default 8). 100% coverage
and 0 overlap are guaranteed by construction (no LLM). When `chunk_size < 1`,
returns `[list(files)]` (degenerate guard). Used by `recursive_decompose()`
when `len(files) > 8` so the code — not the LLM — decides the file partition
(measured correction: LLM splitter dropped 14/29 migration files in testing);
the splitter worker then only *labels* the pre-computed chunks.

`recursive_decompose(subtask, depth, st, caps, models, efforts, repo_root, *, repo_map=None, _parent_score, _noprogress_count) -> list[dict]`
Async recursive function implementing DESIGN §5½ (P1) *Task-Context Fit*. For each
subtask: calls `fit_judge` to score Task-Context Fit (0–1); returns `[subtask]`
if score ≥ 0.70 (threshold from `caps["decompose_fit_threshold"]`) or depth ≥
`caps["decompose_max_depth"]` (5); checks the no-progress guard
(`caps["decompose_noprogress_rounds"]` consecutive rounds of no improvement
accept the subtask as leaf); then splits via either:
  - **Migration path** (≥ 9 files): `partition_files()` owns the file→chunk
    partition (deterministic, 100% coverage). The `splitter` worker is then
    invoked in **label-only mode** (`_label_migration_chunks()`) to write a
    distinct `title` + `success_criteria_seed` per pre-computed chunk — it must
    not move files. §12 code-enforces distinctness: on splitter failure or a
    mismatched label set, every chunk falls back to a distinct deterministic
    label (`_deterministic_chunk_label()`), never an identical parent-copy.
  - **Coupled path** (≤ 8 files): `splitter` LLM worker — structural seam detection

`repo_map` (the once-built global symbol graph passed from `phase_plan`) is
re-ranked per node via `rank_repo_map(repo_map, node_files, [])` and injected
into each `fit_judge`/`splitter` prompt as a "RANKED REPO-MAP SUBGRAPH" section
(DESIGN §5½ P6 — "feed the same to the splitter, re-ranked to each node's
files"). `None` (skip_repo_map or build failure) omits the injection.

Every `fit_judge` and `splitter` invocation calls `st.bump_workers(caps)` before
`claude_p()`, which is passed the full required signature
(`cwd=str(repo_root)`, `autonomous=False`, `caps=caps`). Both workers use
`INSPECT_TOOLS` (read-only).

`SCHEMAS["fit_judge"]` — required fields: `score` (number 0–1), `rationale`
(string), `diffuse` (string, narrates the diffuse coupling when score < 0.70),
`confidence` (sub-schema via `_confidence_schema(["fit"])`).

`SCHEMAS["splitter"]` — required field: `children` (array, `minItems: 1`). Each
child mirrors the planner subtask shape: required `id`, `title`,
`success_criteria_seed`; optional `intent`, `scope_note`, `files_likely_touched`,
`depends_on`, `requires`, `provides`, `size`, `investigation_notes`.

Both workers are registered in `WORKER_TYPES` and `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`
(both default to `"high"`). Both are absent from `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`
(default opus via the global `MODEL_DEFAULT` fallback).

`--max-turns` by worker: classifier 60, planner 100, reconciler 30,
plan_overlap_judge 30, provision 30, integrator 60, implementer 120,
conformer 60, judge 40, heal patch_generator 40, pr_writer 20, fit_judge 30,
splitter 30. For
the implementer, 120 turns and 90 minutes both apply — whichever trips
first. The conformer cap is lower than the implementer's because its
scope is narrower (read a diff, read a small set of rules files, update
docs/tests, run build/lint/test) and the phase is advisory — running
out of turns becomes a warning, not a failure. The planner cap is the
largest of the inspect-tool workers because the planner drives the §8
confidence loop and is the worker most likely to need additional turns
on heavy domains; a too-tight cap there directly degrades the §8
confidence signal it emits.

The `wave_revalidation_rounds` and `revision_retries` caps were
removed when the wave-level LLM validator and the criteria-revision
channel retired (DESIGN §8, §9). State files from older runs may still
carry the corresponding fields; the orchestrator is read-tolerant of
them.

### Worker-internal caps (prompt-governed — NOT counted by the orchestrator)
These iterate inside one worker; the orchestrator sees only the final result.
The real backstop is the worker's `--max-turns` above.

| Loop | Instructed limit | Instructed outcome |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| evidence-gate iterations (implementer) | `confidence_rounds` (default 8) | return `blocked` |
| evidence-gate iterations (planner) | `confidence_rounds` (default 8) | emit `status: "blocked"`, empty subtasks, gap analysis |
| validate-against-criteria iterations (implementer) | 5 | return `failed` |

The `confidence_rounds` cap is user-tunable (see §2 "Confidence rounds")
even though the iterations themselves are counted inside the worker. The
guarantee remains prompt-governed per DESIGN §13.

Per DESIGN §10 #1, **granular sizing is the primary defense** against
context exhaustion — these caps are a safety net, not the main path.
If they fire often, the planner is under-decomposing (DESIGN §5); look
there first when handoffs become routine.

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §13. The code-enforced / prompt-governed split there is
*the* point — do not present the second table as a code guarantee.

### The two-tier retry policy — `_retryable_failure(kind)`
One classifier function decides retryable vs. terminal. It dispatches on a
structured `failure_kind` enum tagged at the producer; the prose `reason`
stays for user-visible diagnostics but no longer drives control flow. The
retryable set is the module-level constant `_RETRYABLE_FAILURE_KINDS`.

Per DESIGN §12, classification by substring match on a prose `reason`
would be deterministic code making a judgment call on natural-language
text — a model should classify prose; a substring match cannot. Tagging
at the producer eliminates the prose round-trip.

The coupling test in `tests/test_retryable_failure.py` enforces that
every retryable-path return from a producer (`validate_result`,
`check_branch_has_commits`, the inline dirty-worktree check) carries a
`failure_kind` in `_RETRYABLE_FAILURE_KINDS`. When adding a new
retryable failure mode, extend the enum and update the producer in the
same change.

| Failure | Tier | `failure_kind` / source |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| branch has no commits ahead of the run branch | Retryable | `"no_commits"` from `check_branch_has_commits` |
| worktree left dirty | Retryable | `"dirty_worktree"` from the inline dirty-worktree check in `settle_subtask` |
| `incomplete-handoff` worker produced no checkpoint on disk | Retryable | `"empty_handoff"` from `validate_result`'s incomplete-handoff branch when the checkpoint file is missing. Triggers in two known cases: (1) Claude Code session-limit / rate-limit no-op workers leave no checkpoint (primarily caught by `detect_session_limit()` upstream; this is the safety net for a message-format change), and (2) a worker that hit `--max-turns` with no checkpoint written, which `run_implementer`'s WorkerError handler synthesizes into the same envelope. Both are corrective-note cases. |
| cross-field invariant violation (other) | Terminal | `"broken"` from `validate_result` |
| diff touched a protected path | Terminal | `"broken"` from `check_diff_scope` |
| worker-level error (timeout, schema-invalid twice) | Terminal | `"broken"` from `WorkerError` path |

`settle_subtask` routes every failure through `_retryable_failure` via the
`fail(kind, reason)` helper. Retryable consumes the retry cap; terminal ends
the subtask on first occurrence.

On a retryable failure that will loop, `fail()` calls
`_reset_subtask_worktree(sid, leerie_dir, run_id)` to remove the leftover
per-subtask worktree directory and its branch
(`leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/<sid>`), then `git worktree prune` to clear the
stale `.git/worktrees/<sid>/` metadata entry, so the retry's `new-worktree.sh`
reaches its "fresh subtask" path on the next iteration. Without this reset the
retry re-runs the script against a still-registered worktree and an existing
branch — the second `git worktree add -b` fails with
`fatal: a branch ... already exists`, the `WorkerError` escapes
`settle_subtask`, and `gather_or_cancel` takes down the rest of the wave.

## 6½. Per-repo dependency provisioning

Implements DESIGN §6½. The provision phase fires once per fresh run,
between classify and plan; on `--resume` the whole fresh-run else-branch
of `orchestrate()` is skipped, so no re-fire check is needed.

### Worker registration

`WORKER_TYPES` gains `"provision"`. `SCHEMAS["provision"]` is the JSON
schema for the LLM-fallback recipe:

```python
{
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["recipe"],
    "properties": {
        "recipe": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "required": ["kind", "command", "working_dir"],
                "properties": {
                    "kind": {"enum": ["install", "build", "none"]},
                    "command": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {"type": "string"},
                        "minItems": 1,
                    },
                    "working_dir": {"type": "string"},
                    "timeout_s": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1},
                },
            },
        },
        "confidence": {"type": "string"},
        "notes": {"type": "string"},
    },
}
```

`detect_recipe_from_lockfiles(repo_root) -> list[dict]` is the
deterministic table. It returns a list of `{kind, command, working_dir,
timeout_s}` dicts — possibly empty (table miss → LLM fallback), possibly
multi-entry (polyglot repos like Rails-with-frontend emit *all* matches,
not first-wins).

| Detected file | Emitted command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | takes precedence over yarn.lock and package-lock.json |
| `yarn.lock` (no pnpm-lock.yaml) | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` | |
| `package-lock.json` (neither above) | `npm ci` | |
| `uv.lock` | `uv sync` | |
| `poetry.lock` | `poetry install` | |
| `Pipfile.lock` | `pipenv install` | |
| `go.mod` + `go.sum` | `go mod download` | |
| `Cargo.lock` | `cargo fetch` | |
| `Gemfile.lock` | `bundle install` | |
| `composer.lock` | `composer install --no-interaction` | |
| `packages.lock.json` | `dotnet restore` | NuGet lockfile |
| anything else | (no entry — caller falls back to LLM worker) | bare `requirements.txt`, bare `pyproject.toml`, Maven (`pom.xml`), Gradle, polyglot Makefile |

`validate_provision_recipe(recipe) -> None` enforces (raises `ValueError`
on violation):
- `command[0]` is in the argv allowlist `{pnpm, npm, yarn, pip, pip3,
  uv, poetry, go, cargo, bundle, gem, mvn, gradle, gradlew, make,
  composer, dotnet}`.
- No `sudo` anywhere in the argv.
- No shell metacharacters (`|`, `&`, `;`, `$`, backticks, `>`, `<`, `\n`)
  in any argv element.
- `working_dir` is either `"."` or a relative path with no `..` segments
  and no leading `/`.

### Phase implementation (`phase_provision`)

Insertion point in `orchestrate()`: inside the `else:` (fresh-run)
branch, after the `_write_run_json(...)` block and before
`gather_answers(st, supplied)`. Step order:

1. **Docs-only short-circuit.** If the categories from classify
   contain no code-touching category (only `documentation`, etc.),
   record `kind: none` and return.
2. **Setup hook.** `run_setup_hook(repo_root, log_dir, st)` execs
   `<repo>/.leerie-setup.sh` if present (10-min timeout, streams to
   `<state-root>/runs/<id>/logs/setup-hook.log`). Idempotent via
   `st.data["provision"]["sh_hook_ran"]`. Nonzero exit → `die()`.
   **Runs as the non-root `leerie` container user; no sudo.** The hook
   can install user-space tooling (`mise install <lang>@<version>`,
   anything writing to `~/.local/bin`) and pre-populate fixtures, but
   cannot `apt-get install` or write to system directories. Repos
   that need root-level system packages maintain a fork of the leerie
   Dockerfile and override `IMAGE_TAG`; out of scope for the hook.
3. **Mise go-override synthesis.** `synth_mise_go_override(
   repo_root, run_dir) -> Path | None`: if `go.mod` exists but the
   repo has no `.go-version`, no `.tool-versions` go entry, and no
   `mise.toml`/`.mise.toml` go pin, parse `go.mod`'s `go 1.X[.Y]`
   directive and write `<run_dir>/mise-overrides.toml` containing
   `[tools]\ngo = "<version>"`. **Both `mise.toml` AND `.mise.toml`
   (dotted form, also a valid mise config name) are recognized**;
   non-dotted form wins if both exist (matches mise's discovery
   precedence). If the repo has an existing mise config, its
   `[tools]` content is preserved in the override file
   (`MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES` replaces rather than merges; the
   override is the only file mise reads, so it must carry the repo's
   existing pins plus leerie's addition). Idiomatic version files
   (`.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.python-version`, `.ruby-version`)
   and `.tool-versions` entries are ALSO copied into the override
   when the same tool isn't already pinned in the existing mise
   config — otherwise the override would silently drop them too
   (mise discussions #6598 / #7058). Returns the absolute path to
   the override file.

   **Precedence between idiomatic files** (leerie's choice, not
   mise's documented behavior): when the synth fires and both
   `.nvmrc` and `.tool-versions` pin the same tool with different
   versions, `.nvmrc` wins. The iteration order in
   `_read_idiomatic_pins` runs the dedicated single-tool files
   (`.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, etc.) BEFORE `.tool-versions`,
   so the first-seen pin sticks. A repo with conflicting pins is
   a misconfiguration, but leerie picks `.nvmrc` over
   `.tool-versions` for determinism. asdf-compatible names like
   `nodejs` and `python3` in `.tool-versions` are normalized to
   mise's `node` / `python` via `_ASDF_TOOL_ALIASES` so a
   `.nvmrc` + `.tool-versions: nodejs ...` repo doesn't end up
   with both `node` and `nodejs` pins in the override.
4. **Mise install.** `run_mise_install(repo_root, log_dir, st)`:
   exports `MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES=<path>` if step 3
   produced one, then runs `mise install` at the repo root. mise
   reads `.tool-versions` natively, and reads `.nvmrc` /
   `.python-version` / `.ruby-version` / `rust-toolchain.toml` /
   `.go-version` because the image sets
   `MISE_IDIOMATIC_VERSION_FILE_ENABLE_TOOLS=node,python,ruby,rust`.
   Ruby uses precompiled binaries (`MISE_RUBY_COMPILE=false` in the
   image) to avoid requiring the full ruby-build toolchain.
   Streams to `<state-root>/runs/<id>/logs/provision.log`. Nonzero exit
   surfaces the failing tool+version to `die()`.
5. **Version capture.** Runs `mise ls --current --json` (the
   subcommand `mise current --json` does not exist; verified
   against mise.usage.kdl). Output is object-keyed-by-tool, each
   value an array of `{version, install_path, source}` objects.
   Raw blob stored at `st.data["provision"]["mise_versions"]`;
   `tools[name][0].version` is the value rendered in `leerie --list`
   and one-line log summaries.
6. **Table-first detection.** `detect_recipe_from_lockfiles(
   repo_root)`. Non-empty result is the recipe (marked
   `source: "table"` in state).
7. **LLM fallback.** Empty table result → `gather_provision_fixtures(
   repo_root)` assembles inputs (see below), `claude_p("provision",
   prompt, fixtures, SCHEMAS["provision"], model)` returns a
   recipe (marked `source: "llm"` in state).
8. **Validate.** `validate_provision_recipe(recipe)`. Reject →
   `die()`.
9. **Persist (do not execute).** Full recipe + `source` + resolved
    versions saved to `st.data["provision"]`. The recipe is not
    executed by `phase_provision` — the implementer and conformer
    workers run install commands from their own worktrees, given the
    recipe via prompt injection
    (`_format_provision_recipe_section()`). See "Worker-driven
    install" below.
10. **Export env.** If `synth_mise_go_override()` created an override
    file, `os.environ["MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES"]` is set to
    its path so every downstream worker subprocess inherits it.

### Helper functions

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gather_provision_fixtures(repo_root) -> dict` | Assembles the LLM-worker input set under a 24KB total ceiling. README extracted by `extract_readme_sections()`; root manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `Makefile`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle*`) included if present; workspace child manifests capped at 3 (1KB each) for monorepos; up to 2 `.github/workflows/*.yml` files matching `(?i)ci\|test\|build\|release` (skip `codeql\|stale\|dependabot`); optional `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` capped at 4KB. |
| `extract_readme_sections(text) -> str` | Header-aware extractor. Strips leading emoji/punctuation before keyword match. Three header styles: ATX (`## ...`), setext (`...\n===` / `...\n---`), asciidoc (`== ...`). Keeps ≤1KB intro + matched sections (8KB post-extract budget). Section-match regex: `(?i)install\|getting[\s-]?started\|quick[\s-]?start\|setup\|usage\|\brun\b\|develop\|build(ing)?( from source\| instructions)?\|compil(e\|ing)( from source)?\|download\|from source\|requirements\|prerequisites\|dependenc(y\|ies)`. Fallback chain on no header match: code-fence detector (`pip install`, `npm install`, `cargo`, `brew`, `go install`, `apt-get`, `make` patterns, ±10 lines) → final top-6KB fallback. |
| `run_setup_hook(repo_root, log_dir, st)` | Execs `<repo>/.leerie-setup.sh` if present with a 10-min timeout via `run_streaming` (live output to terminal + persistent log at `<log_dir>/setup-hook.log`); sets `st.data["provision"]["sh_hook_ran"] = True` on success. |
| `synth_mise_go_override(repo_root, run_dir) -> Path \| None` | See step 3 above. Returns the absolute path to the override file or `None` if no synthesis was needed. |
| `run_mise_install(repo_root, log_dir, st)` | Runs `mise install` + `mise ls --current --json` at `repo_root`. The install streams via `run_streaming` so the user sees per-tool progress on a first-run Python/Ruby/Rust install. |
| `_format_provision_recipe_section(recipe, *, audience) -> str \| None` | Renders the persisted recipe as a `PROVISION_RECIPE:` block for injection into implementer or conformer prompts. Audience-specific framing ("decide whether your subtask needs them" vs "ensure deps before BUILD/LINT/TEST"). Returns None when the recipe is empty or all-`none`. |
| `phase_provision(repo_root, st, models)` | Orchestrates all of the above. Detects + persists the recipe; does NOT execute it (workers run installs in their worktrees per DESIGN §6½). Exports `MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES` to `os.environ` if a synth override was created, so all downstream worker subprocesses inherit it. |
| `run_streaming(cmd, ..., log_path, verbosity, ...)` | Async subprocess helper with live-streamed stdout+stderr, persistent log file, bounded tail deque, and `TimeoutExpired` carrying the tail in `.output`. Used by `run_mise_install` and `run_setup_hook`; replaces the previous `run_proc` calls that buffered output for the entire run duration. |

### Caches

Six host caches mounted into the container, all `rw`. Listed in §0.5
"Bind-mount table." Concurrency-safety verdicts:

- **mise installs** — Safe. Version dirs are immutable once installed;
  mise renames atomically on install.
- **pnpm store** — Safe (CAS, atomic ops; pnpm/discussions#10702).
- **Go modules** — Safe (`flock` per module-version in
  `cmd/go/internal/modfetch`).
- **Cargo** — Safe (flock on index + per-crate locks). Whole
  `CARGO_HOME` is mounted; mounting only `registry/` breaks
  `config.lock` (cargo#11376).
- **pip** — Mixed. Most races fixed (pypa/pip#9470, #12361, #13540
  closed). The wheel-build race #9034 (concurrent `pip install` of
  the same sdist into the same wheel-cache slot) is still open; in
  practice leerie runs a small number of concurrent workers and the
  collision window is narrow. A worker that does hit the race retries
  once via pip's own retry, and a persistent failure surfaces as a
  conformer warning (DESIGN §9), not a silent corruption.

- **Bundler** — Mounted. `BUNDLE_PATH` and `BUNDLE_CACHE_ALL=1` are set
  so `bundle install` reuses cached gems across worktrees and runs.
  The historic `unlink` race (rubygems/bundler#4519) was fixed in
  Bundler 2.2+; all supported Ruby versions ship a sufficiently recent
  Bundler.

### Worker-driven install (replaces per-worktree replay)

`scripts/new-worktree.sh` does just the `git worktree add` and prints
the worktree path. There is **no orchestrator-driven install** after
that — the implementer runs the install itself from its own worktree
via its Bash tool, against the shared package-manager caches. The
conformer does the same before running BUILD/LINT/TEST.

How the recipe reaches the worker:

1. `git worktree add` checks out the worktree (tracked files only).
   It starts with no `node_modules/` / `.venv/` / `target/`, by
   design.
2. The orchestrator parses the worktree path from the script's stdout.
3. `run_implementer` (and later `run_conformer`) read
   `st.data["provision"]["recipe"]` and inject it as a
   `PROVISION_RECIPE:` block in the worker's user prompt via
   `_format_provision_recipe_section(...)`.
4. The worker's prompt (see `prompts/implementer.md` §2 and
   `prompts/conformer.md` §Input) instructs it to decide whether the
   subtask needs the install and to run the command from its
   worktree if yes. The shared store / cache makes re-runs across
   worktrees fast.
5. If the recipe is missing or empty (docs-only run), no
   `PROVISION_RECIPE:` block is injected and the worker proceeds
   without one.
6. Install failures inside a worker surface through the worker's
   normal exit machinery — a hard-failing build/test in the
   implementer becomes a `failed` or `blocked` status; in the
   conformer it surfaces as a `tests-failed: …` advisory warning
   (DESIGN §9).

Why this shape (vs. an orchestrator-driven install at `repo_root` or
per-worktree replay):

- The host's repo is bind-mounted at `repo_root`, so an
  orchestrator-driven install there writes linux-arm64 native
  binaries into the host's darwin `node_modules`, corrupting the
  host's checkout.
- Per-worktree pre-install is wasted work for subtasks that don't
  need built deps (config-only, doc-only, pure-code refactors that
  don't run tests). The barnacle reference run showed ~half of
  implementer subtasks correctly skip install when given the choice.
- `claude -p`'s built-in stream-event plumbing surfaces Bash tool
  I/O to the orchestrator log live, so an install running inside a
  worker is visible to the user without any special orchestrator
  streaming code.

The `MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES` env var that `phase_provision`
synthesizes for polyglot Go repos (go.mod with no `.go-version`
sibling) is exported to `os.environ` once in `phase_provision` (and
re-exported from persisted state on `--resume`); worker subprocesses
inherit it without any per-worker plumbing because `_invoke` does
not pass an explicit `env=` to `create_subprocess_exec`.

**Convention-doc injection (`CONVENTION_DOCS:` block).** Alongside the
recipe, `run_implementer` injects the repo's authoritative convention
docs so the implementer writes UI to the repo's design conventions on
the first try rather than drifting and relying on a post-hoc conformer
catch (DESIGN §9). It calls `discover_rules_files(st.repo_root)` — the
same discovery the conformer uses — and renders the surviving paths
(relative to `repo_root`) as a `CONVENTION_DOCS:` line in the user
prompt, using the same relative-path formatting as `run_conformer`'s
`RULES_FILES:` line. Paths only, not contents: the implementer runs in
a full worktree checkout and opens the docs relevant to its subtask, so
inlining a large design-system doc into every prompt is avoided. When
discovery returns nothing, no block is injected. `st.repo_root` is
already in scope in `run_implementer` (set at `State` construction), so
this needs no new parameter or call-site change. The `prompts/implementer.md`
§3 evidence gate and §4 Implement step name this block so the worker
reconciles the pattern it followed against the discovered conventions.

### Auto-capture of repo dependencies

Implements DESIGN §6½ *Auto-capture of repo dependencies*. All Python
surface lives in `orchestrator/leerie.py`.

#### Capture functions

| Function / Constant | Signature / Value | Role |
|---------------------|-------------------|------|
| `_DEPCAP_TOTAL_BUDGET` | `307200` (bytes) | Byte ceiling for the install-command hint fed to the dep_capture worker (~300 KB ≈ 75k tokens). Mirrors the `gather_provision_fixtures` add_bytes/hit_ceiling idiom. |
| `_DEP_MANIFEST_NAMES` | tuple | Fixed tuple of dependency-manifest filenames gathered as the PRIMARY corpus — matched by exact name, **not** a glob (`requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `requirements-test.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`(`.lock`), `setup.py`/`setup.cfg`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`(`.lock`), `Gemfile`(`.lock`), `composer.json`(`.lock`)). |
| `_DEPCAP_MANIFEST_FILE_BUDGET` / `_DEPCAP_MANIFEST_TOTAL_BUDGET` | `16384` / `131072` (bytes) | Per-file and total byte caps for the gathered manifest corpus. |
| `_DEPCAP_INSTALL_RE` / `_DEPCAP_TEXT_TOOLS` / `_DEPCAP_SEGMENT_RE` | regex / frozenset / regex | Install-verb matcher (verb at a command boundary), the set of text-scanning command words (`grep`/`git`/`sed`/…) excluded from the command hint, and the shell-separator splitter (`\n ; && \|\| \| &`) used to evaluate a chained command per-segment. |
| `_is_install_command` | `(cmd: str) -> bool` | True iff **some shell segment** of `cmd` (split on `_DEPCAP_SEGMENT_RE`) invokes a package-manager install verb (`_DEPCAP_INSTALL_RE`) while that segment's leading word (after an optional `sudo`) is not a text tool. Per-segment evaluation keeps a genuine install chained after a text tool (`echo hi\npip install x`, `git log && pip install x`) while still dropping the leak where the verb is inside the text tool's own arg (`grep "apt-get install intents"`). |
| `_gather_dep_manifests` | `(repo_root: Path) -> str` | Reads the repo's dependency-manifest files (`_DEP_MANIFEST_NAMES`) present in `repo_root`, bounded per file and in total; returns a labeled `### <filename>` block per manifest. The PRIMARY dep_capture corpus (DESIGN §6½). |
| `_extract_depcap_commands` | `(log_dir: Path) -> tuple[str, bool]` | Iterates `sorted(log_dir.glob("*.log"), reverse=True)` (newest-first); calls `_iter_log_tool_use` on each; collects distinct `command` values from `kind == "Bash"` tool-use blocks **that pass `_is_install_command`** into an insertion-order dict. Admits commands under `_DEPCAP_TOTAL_BUDGET` bytes (separator `\n---\n`). The SECONDARY hint (system/native deps) — manifests are primary. Returns `(commands_text, hit_ceiling)`. |
| `_normalize_setup_packages` | `(pkgs: list[str]) -> str` | Renders a package list in the canonical persisted form: order-preserving dedup, space-joined. Shared by `_merge_setup_packages` (union) and the `replace` path so both emit byte-identical TOML values. |
| `_merge_setup_packages` | `(existing: str, captured: list[str]) -> str \| None` | Parses `existing` (space- or comma-separated, per DESIGN §6½); takes the union with `captured`; returns the merged string (via `_normalize_setup_packages`) only if it grew (else `None` → no write). Preserves user-narrowed lists: only genuinely-new packages are appended; nothing is removed. |
| `_dump_language_installs` | `(entries: list[dict]) -> str` | JSON-encodes `language_installs` for TOML persistence, escaping any literal `'` in the payload (e.g. a shell-quoted install command `pip install 'requests[security]'`) as the JSON escape `'`. Guarantees the value contains no literal single quote so `_toml_value`'s single-quoted TOML *literal* wrapper stays valid; `json.loads` (both readers) recovers the original `'`. |
| `_toml_value` | `(val: str) -> str` | Renders `val` as a TOML string for `_write_config_toml_keys`. A value containing `"` (notably the JSON-encoded `language_installs`) is wrapped in a TOML *literal* (single-quoted) string; this requires the value to contain no literal `'` — guaranteed for `language_installs` by `_dump_language_installs`, and trivially true for `setup_packages` (apt names have no quotes). Both readers already `.strip("'")`, so it round-trips with no unescaping; plain values keep the `"..."` basic-string form. Prevents invalid TOML from inner quotes. |
| `_write_config_toml_keys` | `(cfg_path: Path, updates: dict[str, str]) -> None` | Minimal deterministic TOML upsert. Creates the file with a leerie header (matching the launcher's `config --init` heredoc tone) if absent; otherwise replaces the first *uncommented* `key =` line for each key, or appends if absent. Values rendered via `_toml_value`. Never touches commented lines. Writes via temp-file + `os.replace()` (State.save atomicity discipline). |
| `capture_repo_deps` | `async (repo_root: Path, st: State, caps: dict \| None, models: dict[str, str] \| None, efforts: dict[str, str \| None] \| None, replace: bool = False) -> None` | Main entry point. Guards: `resolve_capture_deps`, caps/models/efforts availability, `log_dir` existence, committed `.leerie/Dockerfile` skip. Builds a **manifests-first** corpus: `_gather_dep_manifests` (primary) + `_extract_depcap_commands` (secondary install-command hint); if BOTH are empty, returns. Checks worker budget; invokes `claude_p(schema_key='dep_capture', ...)` with `load_prompt("dep_capture")`, composing a two-section user prompt (manifests, then install-command hint). **`replace=False` (default, every automatic seam):** writes `setup_packages` (via `_merge_setup_packages`, never-clobber) and `language_installs` (new managers only, keyed by `manager` field, never-clobber) to `.leerie/config.toml`. **`replace=True` (only the operator-driven `--recapture --force` path):** wholesale-replaces both keys from the fresh capture (drops deps no longer captured); an empty capture leaves the existing config untouched. Writes via `_write_config_toml_keys`. Non-fatality is enforced at each call site's `try/except`, not inside the function. |
| `resolve_capture_deps` | `(repo_root: Path) -> bool` | env `LEERIE_CAPTURE_DEPS` > `.leerie/config.toml` `capture_deps` key; default `True`. No CLI flag and no `leerie.toml` tier (env → config → default only). |

#### dep_capture worker

`dep_capture` is a non-WORKER_TYPES worker (like `pr_writer`) registered in
`SCHEMAS`, `_allowed_schema_keys`, `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` (high), and
`resolve_models`/`resolve_efforts`. It is **absent** from
`MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`; its `opus` default comes from the global
`MODEL_DEFAULT` fallback. Its model override is env-var-only (no CLI flag, no
`leerie.toml` key): `MODEL_DEP_CAPTURE_ENV = "LEERIE_MODEL_DEP_CAPTURE"`.
System prompt is `prompts/dep_capture.md`. Output schema:

```json
{
  "setup_packages": ["string"],
  "language_installs": [
    {"manager": "string", "command": "string", "copy_inputs": ["string"]}
  ],
  "dockerfile_notes": "string | null"
}
```

`setup_packages` items and each `language_installs` `manager`/`command` carry
`minLength: 1` (mirrors `pr_writer`): a schema-valid empty-item capture would
render to `""` and, under `--recapture --force` (replace path), blank the
persisted config. The schema is the enforcement layer (DESIGN §12); the replace
path additionally gates the write on the rendered value being non-empty.

#### Capture trigger seams

`capture_repo_deps` is called from three seams; all are non-fatal (wrapped in
`try/except`):

1. **Finalize (clean finish).** Called with `await` from `phase_finalize`,
   after `finished_at` is written and run-branch verification completes.
   `caps`, `models`, and `efforts` are forwarded from `phase_finalize`'s
   parameters. The resume-of-finished guard in `_run_phases` returns before
   `phase_finalize` is reached, so capture never re-fires on a completed
   resume. A partial resume that reaches finalize re-runs capture — the union
   merge makes this a no-op when nothing new was found.
   `st.run_dir / "logs" / "*.log"` is populated by this point.

2. **Cancel / SIGTERM arm (catchable signals).** In `main()`'s
   `KeyboardInterrupt` and `InterruptedBySignal` exception handlers, after
   `st.save()`, a best-effort `asyncio.run(capture_repo_deps(...))` runs in
   its own event loop — the same post-loop pattern as the `RateLimitedExit`
   arm. Non-fatal: any exception is logged and suppressed. This covers the
   Ctrl-C and `nerdctl stop` cases where the orchestrator gets a real Python
   window before the `finally` cleanup block.

3. **Host-side (`run_recapture_deps` / run-start backstop).** Two host-side
   seams funnel to the same worker:
   - **`run_recapture_deps(leerie_root, repo_root, force, run_id)`**: the
     on-demand recapture entrypoint invoked by `leerie config --recapture`.
     When `run_id` is given, targets that run only; otherwise consolidates
     across **all** finished runs with `logs/` (newest-first). Each target
     run's `State` is flocked (skipped on `StateLockedError`); with
     `force=True` the sentinel is dropped before capture **and**
     `capture_repo_deps(replace=True)` wholesale-replaces the persisted deps
     (vs. the default never-clobber union). Exits 1 if no runs directory or no
     finished run found; per-run errors are logged and skipped (non-fatal for
     multi-run consolidation).
   - **`_backstop_capture_prior_runs(leerie_root, repo_root, caps, models,
     efforts)`**: called at run-start (in `_run_phases`, before
     `phase_classify`) to cover SIGKILL / crash cases where the cancel arm
     could not fire. Scans `leerie_root/runs/` for run dirs that have `logs/`
     but no `dep_capture.done` sentinel and calls `capture_repo_deps` over
     each via a lightweight ad-hoc state object.

**Idempotency sentinel.** `capture_repo_deps` writes `<run_dir>/dep_capture.done`
(a one-line file) and sets `st.data["dep_capture_done"] = True` after a
successful write. The run-start backstop skips runs whose sentinel file is
present. The `dep_capture_done` state field is defined in `STATE_FIELDS` and
documented in the state-schema table above.

#### Language-dep Dockerfile template (launcher, gated on `bake_language_deps`)

When the launcher auto-generates `.leerie/Dockerfile` from `setup_packages`
(see *Per-repo derived image* above) and `bake_language_deps` resolves to
`true` (default), the generated Dockerfile includes a language-dep layer
after the apt `RUN`:

```dockerfile
COPY <copy_inputs> ./
RUN <install command>
```

The `COPY`+`RUN` layer is emitted by a `python3` script the launcher
writes to a temp file (`cat >"$_dep_pyf" <<'PY'`) and runs as
`python3 "$_dep_pyf" "$USER_REPO" "$_leerie_config_toml"` — de-nested
from a `"$(…)"` command substitution so the block parses under bash 3.2
(it is extracted and run under the system bash by the Dockerfile-bake
tests). It has two tiers:

1. **Primary — persisted `language_installs` from `.leerie/config.toml`.**
   The `dep_capture` worker writes a `language_installs` JSON array (keyed
   by `manager`) to `.leerie/config.toml`. When this key is present, the
   launcher reads it, iterates over every `{manager, command, copy_inputs}`
   entry, and emits one `COPY`+`RUN` block per manager. Each `copy_input`
   is validated with `p.exists()` before being added to the `COPY` list —
   hallucinated paths are silently dropped while the `RUN` line is always
   emitted (the install command itself is authoritative; the COPY list is
   advisory). Multiple managers yield multiple `COPY`+`RUN` layers.

2. **Fallback — lockfile detection (clean first run).** When no
   `language_installs` key is present in config.toml (e.g. on the very
   first run before `dep_capture` has fired), the script mirrors
   `_lockfile_table_entries`'s manager-precedence by hand to detect a
   single lockfile manager. For **all** node ecosystems (pnpm, yarn, npm)
   a shared `_node_ancillary` helper adds workspace `package.json`s,
   `patches/`, `.npmrc`, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, because the frozen
   install requires them — workspace globs come from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
   (pnpm) or `package.json`'s `workspaces` field (yarn/npm, both list and
   `{packages: [...]}` forms). On a build failure (e.g. a missing patch
   file), the launcher falls back to `bake_language_deps=false` (apt layer
   only) and logs loudly.

**COPY-input-sha rebuild trigger.** Every file that participates in the
`COPY` list — lockfiles, manifests, workspace children, `patches/*`,
`.npmrc` — has its `sha256` embedded in a `# copy-input-shas:` comment
line inside the generated Dockerfile, so the Dockerfile's own sha
(the single `.dockerfile-hash` site) folds them in. Any dependency-input
change — a lockfile bump *or* a patch edit that leaves the lockfile
untouched — triggers a full image rebuild; an unrelated source file
change does not. The Fly path inherits the same generated Dockerfile via
the seed-repo whitelist, so there is no second hash site.

When `bake_language_deps=false`, the auto-generated Dockerfile contains
only the apt layer (`USER root; apt-get install ...`), identical to the
pre-existing path. The generated Dockerfile ends with the image still at
`USER root` — it does **not** append a trailing `USER leerie`. The base
image's ENTRYPOINT (`scripts/container-entry.sh`) is inherited by the
derived image and **must** run as PID-1 root to set up cgroup containment
and launch the cgroup broker before dropping to leerie itself via `runuser`
(DESIGN §6 *Memory containment*; the base Dockerfile deliberately omits
`USER leerie` for the same reason). A trailing `USER leerie` here would
override that, making PID 1 run as leerie — cgroup writes, the broker
socket bind, and `runuser` then all fail EACCES and the container exits 1.

#### Config knobs

Two new config keys. Neither has a CLI flag. Their precedence differs by
resolver:
- `capture_deps` (orchestrator, `resolve_capture_deps`): env
  `LEERIE_CAPTURE_DEPS` > `.leerie/config.toml` > default. Does **not**
  consult `leerie.toml`.
- `bake_language_deps` (launcher): env `LEERIE_BAKE_LANGUAGE_DEPS` >
  `leerie.toml` > `.leerie/config.toml` > default.

| Key | Env override | Default | Meaning |
|-----|-------------|---------|---------|
| `capture_deps` | `LEERIE_CAPTURE_DEPS` | `true` | Enable finalize-time dependency capture. Set to `false` to disable entirely. |
| `bake_language_deps` | `LEERIE_BAKE_LANGUAGE_DEPS` | `true` | Include language-dep `COPY`+`RUN` layer in auto-generated Dockerfile. Set to `false` for apt-only bake. |

Both keys are resolved by their respective `resolve_*` functions before
the finalize hook fires (`capture_deps` by `resolve_capture_deps` in the
orchestrator; `bake_language_deps` by the launcher's own resolver). They
are not emitted into `leerie config --init` output — that heredoc
documents only `build`/`lint`/`test`/`setup_packages` — but they are
documented in the `CLAUDE.md` quick-start and here.

Conforms to DESIGN §6½ *Auto-capture of repo dependencies*.

## 7. Git worktree mechanics (`scripts/*.sh`)

Every script takes a `RUN_ID` as its first positional argument (after any flags) so the per-run namespacing is explicit at the shell boundary, not implicit through `cwd`.

| Script | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `setup-run.sh <run-id>` | Creates `leerie/runs/<run-id>` **only if absent** — never force-resets it (an existing branch carries completed waves; resetting it would destroy resume state). Records the working branch (HEAD-at-run-start) to `${LEERIE_STATE_DIR:-.leerie}/runs/<run-id>/working-branch` on first run only. Adds the run-branch worktree at `${LEERIE_STATE_DIR:-.leerie}/runs/<run-id>/worktrees/staging` if missing. Safe on `--resume`. |
| `new-worktree.sh <id> <run-id>` | Creates `leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/<id>` worktree at `${LEERIE_STATE_DIR:-.leerie}/runs/<run-id>/worktrees/<id>` branched off the current `leerie/runs/<run-id>` tip. Canonicalizes the worktree path to absolute (`pwd -P`) before comparing against `git worktree list --porcelain` output (which always uses absolute, symlink-resolved paths); reuses an existing worktree/branch if present (resume after handoff). Prints the absolute worktree path. The run-branch (`leerie/runs/…`) and subtask-branch (`leerie/subtasks/…`) prefixes are deliberately disjoint so neither is an ancestor ref of the other — git's loose ref store cannot hold a ref AT a path and another ref UNDER that same path simultaneously. |
| `integrate.sh <id> <run-id>` | From repo root, inside the run-branch worktree (`${LEERIE_STATE_DIR:-.leerie}/runs/<run-id>/worktrees/staging`): `git merge --no-ff leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/<id>`. Exit 0 clean; exit 1 on conflict, leaving the worktree mid-merge for an integrator; exit 2 on precondition failure (run-branch worktree or subtask branch missing) — `integrate_wave` treats exit 2 as fatal via `die()` and does *not* spawn an integrator, since the worktree-less case would fail in confusing ways. |
| `finalize.sh <run-id>` | Run-branch verifier. Exits 0 if `refs/heads/leerie/runs/<run-id>` exists and contains at least one commit beyond the working branch; exits non-zero with a diagnosis otherwise. The working branch is **never** modified — leerie does not merge into it locally; the PR is the proposed integration. The push and PR step lives in the **host launcher** (`leerie` bash script), not in the container — it runs after `nerdctl run` exits cleanly, using the host's own `git push` + `gh pr create` against the host's auth state. See "Host-side finalize" below. |
| `cleanup.sh [--run-id <id> \| --all-runs] [--branches \| --subtask-branches]` | Default (no flag): scans `<state-root>/runs/*/state.json` for the most-recently-failed run (most recent without `finished_at`), confirms y/N, then removes only that run's worktrees + prunes git metadata. State dir stays as audit. `--run-id <id>` is an explicit single-run cleanup (worktrees only). `--all-runs` runs the same per-run cleanup across every run dir under `<state-root>/runs/`. `--branches` (combinable with `--run-id` or `--all-runs`) additionally deletes the matching run branches *and* subtask branches (`leerie/runs/<id>` and `leerie/subtasks/<id>/*`). `--subtask-branches` deletes only the subtask branches and keeps `leerie/runs/<id>` (the post-finalize default — the run branch is the PR head and must outlive the orchestrator). Without either flag, all branches are kept as an audit trail. State dirs are always preserved by `cleanup.sh`. Ctrl-C and every other abnormal exit in the orchestrator also preserve state — they call `_cleanup_on_abnormal_exit(full_purge=False)`. There is no `full_purge=True` call site today; the flag is retained as a future hook for an explicit-purge gesture, but no current code path uses it. |

A run branch `leerie/runs/<run-id>` is never reset once created — this is the invariant `--resume` depends on. See `DESIGN.md` §6 ("the run branch is the resume contract").

### Host-side finalize (bash + jq in the `leerie` launcher)

The push + PR step runs on the **host** in the launcher, after `nerdctl
run` exits cleanly. The container's `phase_finalize` writes
`finished_at` to `run.json` and exits 0; the launcher polls that
sentinel and proceeds. See DESIGN.md §6 *Finalization* for the
architecture (auth state lives in host processes the container can't
reach; the boundary is structural).

The launcher's finalize block in `leerie` (bash) does, in order:

1. **Skip if `--no-push`.** Same opt-out as before.
2. **Read run state** via `jq` from `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<run-id>/run.json` and
   `state.json` (run branch, working branch, finished_at).
3. **Push the run branch.** `git push -u origin leerie/runs/<run-id>`
   (with `--no-verify` if the flag was set). On failure: print the
   same multi-line message as the old Python path (names run branch +
   working branch, captured stderr, exact retry command), update
   `run.json` with `push_error`, exit non-zero.
4. **Compose PR title + body.** Primary path: read `pr_title` /
   `pr_body` from `run.json` — these are written by the `pr_writer`
   worker that `phase_finalize` invokes when `push_will_happen` is
   true (see DESIGN §6 *Finalization* and §9 *Structured-output
   schemas* `pr_writer` entry). Fallback path (pr_writer skipped or
   crashed): a bash heredoc reads `state.json` fields with `jq` and
   emits the deterministic body shape that `compose_pr_body` produces
   (task, category, source-of-truth, run timestamps, wave + subtask +
   worker counts, and — when `external_preconditions` is non-empty — a
   `⚠ Deploy-ordering` section rendered from it via `jq`, byte-identical
   to the Python renderer; see "Deploy-ordering notes"). The launcher
   branches on whether `pr_title_llm` / `pr_body_llm` are non-empty.
5. **Open PR.** Before calling `gh pr create`, validate that
   `working_branch` still exists on origin via `git ls-remote
   --exit-code --heads`. If the branch was deleted (common when a
   stacked run's parent was squash-merged while this run was in
   flight), fall back to the repo's default branch (`git remote show
   origin | sed 's/.*HEAD branch: //'`). Then:
   `gh pr create --base <working-branch> --head
   leerie/runs/<run-id> --title "leerie: <pr_title>" --body-file -`
   with the composed body piped on stdin. On failure: log a warning
   with the pushed-branch URL and a retry command (using the
   resolved base — original or fallback); update `run.json` with
   `pr_error`. **Non-fatal** — exit 0 (the run is complete; only
   the PR is missing).

**Local runtime only.** The inline finalize block above runs only when
`LEERIE_RUNTIME != "fly"`. On Fly the run dir is not yet on the host
when this block would otherwise execute (it's on the Fly Machine and
gets streamed back inside the EXIT trap `decide_teardown` that fires
*later*). The Fly path runs the same `host_finalize` function from a
different call site — see *Remote execution mode* below.

**Preflight (`leerie` bash, before `nerdctl run`):** the launcher
checks `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, `shutil.which gh`,
`gh auth status`, and `git remote get-url origin` BEFORE spinning up
the container. Each failure dies with the same actionable message
actionable messages about each failure, plus the `--no-push`
escape hatch. The orchestrator no longer runs these checks; they
moved to the host where the auth state actually lives.

`--no-push` skips the entire push + PR step. CLI flag, `LEERIE_NO_PUSH`
env, `no_push = true` in `leerie.toml`. **Both the launcher (bash) and
the in-container orchestrator (Python) resolve `no_push` from all three
sources** so they agree on intent: the orchestrator's
`resolve_no_push()` and the launcher's
inline TOML fallback (mirroring `_read_toml_key`'s flat grep — no
`tomllib` dependency, since the launcher runs on the user's host where
Python 3.9 is still common) both check CLI → env → TOML. Disagreement
on a TOML-only opt-out would make the Fly auto-finalize path push
against user intent (the launcher seeds `fly-machine.json.host_no_push`
and the `--host-no-push` argv; the orchestrator gates `pr_writer` and
writes `run.json.no_push`). `--no-verify` is CLI-only and only
affects the push step (worker `git commit`s inside worktrees still
run all hooks).

### Remote execution mode

`--runtime fly` (or `LEERIE_RUNTIME=fly` / `leerie.toml runtime=fly`) routes
execution to Fly.io Machines instead of the local `nerdctl run`. The
Colima/containerd preflight block is gated on `RUNTIME=local` and skipped
entirely when `RUNTIME=fly`. `--runtime` flows through `REWRITTEN_ARGS`
to the orchestrator's argparse.

Resolution order (highest priority first):

1. **`--runtime local|fly`** CLI flag. Passed through to the
   orchestrator so both the launcher and the orchestrator share the same
   resolved value.
2. **`LEERIE_RUNTIME`** environment variable, values `local` | `fly`.
3. **`leerie.toml`** at the repo root, `runtime = local|fly`.
4. **Default `local`** — local `nerdctl run` is used when unset.

Invalid values in env or TOML are rejected immediately with an error
message and exit 1 before any preflight runs.

**Runtime auto-detection on run-id-bearing verbs:** the shared
`_auto_detect_fly_runtime(run_id, explicit_runtime)` helper checks for
`$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/$run_id/fly-machine.json`. If
present and `explicit_runtime` is empty, it returns 0 and the caller
promotes the local runtime variable to `fly`. Applied to `--resume` (which
also appends `--runtime fly` to `REWRITTEN_ARGS` and tracks the
`_RUNTIME_EXPLICIT` flag), `--stop`, `--kill`, and `--finalize`. When the
user explicitly passes `--runtime local` on a Fly-originated run, `--resume`
warns but respects the choice; the fast-path verbs reject it as before.

When `RUNTIME=fly`, the launcher skips the per-OS nerdctl preflight, the
image-build check, the auth/cache mount assembly, and the `nerdctl run`
invocation, and instead calls the remote dispatch path via
`scripts/remote/provision.sh`.

#### Machine lifecycle (`scripts/remote/provision.sh`)

The provision script is **sourced** (not exec'd) by the launcher so the
machine ID and destroy trap live in the launcher's process. It provides
two functions:

- **`provision_machine()`** — creates a Fly Machine from `$FLY_IMAGE_TAG`
  (set by the launcher; see below), polls `flyctl machine status` until the
  machine reaches state `started`, and registers `decide_teardown` as an
  EXIT/INT/TERM trap. Exports `$LEERIE_MACHINE_ID`. Returns 0 on success;
  destroys the machine and returns 1 on failure. Writes `fly_machine_id`
  and `image_tag` (from `$FLY_IMAGE_TAG`) to the run sidecar
  (`$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<run-id>/run.json`) when `$LEERIE_RUN_ID`
  is set in the environment — written immediately after provision succeeds
  so a launcher crash before classification still leaves a recoverable
  pointer. The `image_tag` field enables `resume_machine()` to detect
  version drift on `--resume` and update the machine's image before
  starting it.
- **`stop_machine()`** — runs `flyctl machine stop $LEERIE_MACHINE_ID
  --app $FLY_APP`, tolerant of already-stopped machines. Preserves the
  machine's filesystem on its Fly volume so `resume-machine.sh` can wake
  it later.
- **`destroy_machine()`** — runs `flyctl machine destroy $LEERIE_MACHINE_ID
  --app $FLY_APP --force`, with a stop-then-destroy fallback for machines
  that are already in a terminal state.
- **`decide_teardown()`** — the trap entry point. Classifies
  `$LEERIE_REMOTE_EXIT_RC` (set by the launcher just before exit) and
  dispatches one of three ways:
  - `destroy_machine` for genuine terminal exits (rc=0, EXIT_NEEDS_ANSWERS=10,
    EX_TEMPFAIL=75): the orchestrator exited cleanly and the machine has no
    further value.
  - **Detach** for rc=130/143 (host-side SIGINT/SIGTERM): the user pressed
    Ctrl-C or the local stream broke (laptop closed, WiFi dropped). Since the
    orchestrator on the machine was started detached (Python
    `subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True, user="leerie", ...)`,
    see *Worker auth + config seeding* below), it is still running. The function
    leaves the machine alone, prints a one-line "detached" banner with the
    reattach / pause / kill commands, and returns.
  - `stop_machine` for unknown non-zero failures (worker error,
    orchestrator exception): preserves the machine's filesystem on its Fly
    volume so the user can attach to inspect and then `leerie --resume`. On the
    stop branch, writes `paused_at` and `pause_reason` to the run sidecar.

  Idempotent (the trap fires on every exit, including success).

The classification table is the canonical authority on which exit
codes are treated as which disposition; DESIGN §6 *Detached orchestrator
(remote mode)* and *Remote pause-on-failure (Fly.io)* document the
rationale.

Environment variables consumed by `provision.sh`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LEERIE_FLY_APP` | — (required) | Fly.io app name. Fly app names are globally unique; set via `--fly-app` or env. |
| `FLY_IMAGE_TAG` | `registry.fly.io/<app>:<version>` | Full image tag to launch (set by the launcher) |
| `FLY_REGION` | `iad` | Fly.io region |
| `FLY_VM_CPUS` | `4` | vCPU count for the machine. Setting >8 auto-promotes to Fly's `performance` CPU class (much more expensive — ~14x per CPU-second). |
| `FLY_VM_MEMORY` | `8192` | Memory in MB for the machine. Setting >16384 auto-promotes to Fly's `performance` CPU class. |
| `FLY_VM_DISK_GB` | `8` (on Fly runtime) | Per-machine Fly volume size in GB, mounted at `/work` — the path where the seeded repo, `.leerie/runs/<id>/` state, and per-subtask worktrees all live (and grow). The launcher defaults to `8` when `RUNTIME=fly` and no explicit value is given (CLI / env / toml). The volume is destroyed when the machine is destroyed (clean exit or `--kill`). Override to a larger value for runs that hit ENOSPC (the rootfs is hard-capped at 2,000 IOPS / 8 MiB/s — N-wide worktree fans-out hit both the IOPS ceiling and the size cap fast). `/home/leerie` (caches + the `.claude` auth bundle) stays on the rootfs — `seed_auth` runs unconditionally on every resume, so the auth bundle is refreshed from host `$STAGE` regardless of pause length. |
| `LEERIE_MACHINE_START_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Seconds to wait for `state=started` |

`FLY_IMAGE_TAG` is resolved by the launcher (`resolve_fly_image_tag()`)
using `$LEERIE_FLY_APP` and `$LEERIE_VERSION`, or overridden by setting
`LEERIE_FLY_IMAGE` in the environment.

`provision_machine` requires `flyctl` on `PATH` and `flyctl auth status`
to succeed. The launcher's `RUNTIME=fly` preflight calls `require_flyctl`
from `scripts/remote/lib.sh` *before* sourcing any other remote script —
that helper detects missing `flyctl` and prompts for `brew install
flyctl` (macOS) or the Fly install script (Linux), then prompts for
`flyctl auth login` if unauthenticated. The auto-install mirrors the
local-runtime auto-install in `scripts/install.sh:200-208` and respects
`--no-runtime-install` / `LEERIE_NO_RUNTIME_INSTALL=1` (falls back to
hint-and-exit-1). By the time `provision_machine` runs, `flyctl` is
guaranteed to be on PATH and authenticated.

#### Private ssh-agent isolation (`_leerie_fly_agent_ensure`)

Before any `flyctl ssh ...` call can run, the launcher's `RUNTIME=fly`
branch invokes `_leerie_fly_agent_ensure` (in `scripts/remote/lib.sh`)
to spawn — or reuse — a leerie-owned ssh-agent at
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/leerie/agent/ssh-agent.sock` and
export `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to point at it for the rest of the process
tree. The user's main ssh-agent is never touched.

This isolation matters because `flyctl ssh issue --agent` is
**additive** — it appends a fresh 24h cert to the agent and never
deletes prior certs. With multiple `require_fly_ssh` callers per
leerie run (seed-auth + two seed-repo paths), aiming flyctl at the
user's main agent accumulates dozens of certs, which OpenSSH then
offers to every ssh destination (including `github.com`). After
~5 failed auth attempts per connection, GitHub rate-limits the
account. Containing all Fly certs in a private agent reachable only
by leerie's process tree eliminates the failure mode.

The private agent is persistent (lazy-spawned, never auto-killed)
so the 24h cert is fully reused across leerie runs — re-issuing on
every invocation was what produced the original accumulation. Reboot
wipes the socket inode; the next run lazy-spawns fresh. Parallel
leerie invocations serialize on `~/.cache/leerie/agent/.spawn.lock`
via `mkdir`-as-mutex (portable across darwin/linux without the
non-stdlib `flock` binary that macOS lacks); only the first spawn
wins, the rest see a live socket and reuse it.

#### Worker auth + config seeding (`scripts/remote/seed-auth.sh`)

After `provision_machine()` returns successfully, the launcher sources
`scripts/remote/seed-auth.sh` and calls `seed_auth()`. This is the remote
equivalent of the `AUTH_MOUNTS` bind-mount block (launcher lines ~542–726):
instead of mounting `$STAGE` as container volumes, the same content is
delivered via `flyctl ssh console -C` tar-pipe + small shell-command
invocations. (`flyctl machine exec` is NOT used — current flyctl removed
both `--stdin` on `machine exec` and the post-`--` argv form; `ssh
console -C` is the only flyctl transport that takes the remote command
as a single string AND forwards host stdin.)

`seed_auth()` performs six steps:

1. **Hallpass readiness probe.** Call `require_fly_ssh` (ensures the
   leerie-private ssh-agent — see above — holds a valid Fly cert,
   issuing only if no cert exists) and `wait_for_fly_ssh_ready` (poll
   `flyctl ssh console --pty=false -C true` against the target
   machine until success; hallpass takes 5-30 s to come up after
   `flyctl machine start` reports "started"). This is the *only*
   hallpass probe in a run — subsequent transports (`seed_repo_clone`
   parent + submodule bundles, `seed_repo_dirty` rsync) rely on each
   pipe's own `LEERIE_SEED_TIMEOUT_S` wrapper (rc 124/137) as the
   authoritative failure detector. An extra probe before each pipe
   would only manufacture false-positives — the channel is
   demonstrably warm by the time seed_auth's multi-MB tar-pipe and
   plugin-cache rebuild have finished. Bound: ~175 s total (12
   attempts × 10 s per-probe timeout + 11 × 5 s sleep); on success
   emits `remote: hallpass ready on <machine>`; on the rare exit-137
   exhaustion (timeout's SIGKILL fire OR external SIGKILL like macOS
   Jetsam under host pressure), the warning includes the "killed
   externally" diagnostic so the operator can distinguish client-side
   pressure from a real Fly outage.

2. **Tar-pipe delivery of `$STAGE` to /home/leerie.** `tar -czC $STAGE`
   (gzip-compressed; excluding `.gitconfig`, `.gitconfig.local`, `.gitignore`,
   `.gitignore_global`, `.git-credentials`, `.netrc`, `.ssh`,
   `.gnupg`, `.config`; with `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` on the host-side
   tar to silence macOS BSD tar's per-file
   `LIBARCHIVE.xattr.com.apple.provenance` warnings on the remote
   GNU tar) is piped to `flyctl ssh console --pty=false -C "sh -c
   'tar -xzC /home/leerie && chown -R leerie: /home/leerie'"`. The
   `chown -R leerie:` is necessary because the ssh-console session
   lands as root with default umask; without it the orchestrator
   (which runs as leerie) couldn't read its own credentials. The
   `leerie:` (trailing colon, no group name) uses leerie's numeric
   primary group rather than hard-coding a literal group name —
   leerie's primary GID is `HOST_GID` (defaults to 20 / staff on
   macOS hosts) and the group is not necessarily called `leerie`.

   The launcher's `$STAGE` build skips `.claude/local` (~408 MB
   host npm install of `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) — the leerie
   image installs claude globally via the Dockerfile, so shipping
   the host's local install is pure dead weight — plus
   `.claude/plugins/cache/` and `.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`
   (hundreds of MB of installed plugin contents, dominated by
   per-plugin `node_modules/` like vercel's ~150 MB; rebuilt on
   the remote in step 6 from the small JSON metadata files that
   ride along). Empirically the stage drops from ~642 MB to
   ~30 MB pre-gzip / ~15 MB on the wire. This is load-bearing: at
   ~640 MB the `ssh console -C` stdin pipe was hitting EOFs in
   live testing.

   On transient "tunnel unavailable" failure from a freshly-spawned
   flyctl agent, the seed retries once after `flyctl agent restart`.

3. **Token fallback.** If `$STAGE/.claude/.credentials.json` was
   not written (Linux, or macOS Keychain extraction failure) but
   `$CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set, `seed_auth()` writes a
   minimal credentials JSON
   `{"claudeAiOauth":{"accessToken":"<token>"}}` directly to
   `/home/leerie/.claude/.credentials.json` on the machine via
   `flyctl ssh console -C "sh -c 'cat > .../credentials.json
   && chmod 600 ... && chown leerie: ...'"`. If neither source is
   available, `seed_auth()` returns 1 with an actionable error.

4. **Git identity.** Reads `user.name` and `user.email` from the
   host's git config and writes them to
   `/home/leerie/.gitconfig` on the machine via
   `flyctl ssh console -C "sh -c 'IFS= read -r n; IFS= read -r e;
   git config --file /home/leerie/.gitconfig user.name \"\$n\" &&
   git config --file /home/leerie/.gitconfig user.email \"\$e\" &&
   chown leerie: /home/leerie/.gitconfig'"` with the two values piped
   on stdin. Note: NOT `git config --global` — under the
   ssh-console session's default root user that would write to
   `/root/.gitconfig` where the leerie user can't read it. Worker
   commits carry the host user's identity.

5. **Pre-warm `claude --version`** once as the leerie user via
   `flyctl ssh console -C "su leerie -c 'HOME=/home/leerie PATH=... claude
   --version'"`. The FIRST `claude --version` on a freshly-booted
   Fly machine takes ~17 s (Node runtime + statsig client cold-start);
   subsequent calls return in <0.2 s. Paying this upfront means the
   orchestrator's preflight `_check_claude_cli_version` call hits
   warm caches.

6. **Rebuild plugin cache.** The tar pipe excludes
   `plugins/cache/` and `plugins/marketplaces/` (see step 2); the
   small JSON metadata files (`installed_plugins.json`,
   `known_marketplaces.json`) ride along and are the source of
   truth for rebuilding. Inside one `flyctl ssh console` invocation
   (running as the leerie user via `runuser -u leerie -- env HOME=...
   PATH=... sh -s` — not `su -c 'sh -s'`, which has implementation-
   specific stdin-forwarding under util-linux) a shell heredoc runs
   two phases: (a) read `known_marketplaces.json` with a python3
   one-liner — jq isn't in the image — emit each `source.repo` and
   run `claude plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>`; (b) read
   `installed_plugins.json` keys (e.g., `vercel@claude-plugins-official`)
   and run `claude plugin install` per entry. Output is appended to
   `/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/plugin-install.log`. Per-plugin
   failures are logged (`WARN: <spec> install failed (continuing)`)
   but non-fatal — a missing plugin only matters if a user-supplied
   task explicitly invokes it, in which case the Claude CLI's
   existing "plugin not found in cache" skip-with-warning behavior
   is the appropriate surface. The invocation is bracketed with the
   same `$(_seed_timeout_prefix)` + `_seed_progress_bg
   "plugin_rebuild"` heartbeat the main tar pipe uses (step 2 above),
   so a stalled `flyctl ssh console` produces a clean rc 124/137
   instead of an indefinite hang and the user sees `plugin_rebuild:
   still streaming (Ns elapsed)` lines on the happy path. The rc is
   captured via `|| _rebuild_rc=$?` (which both grabs the rc and
   suppresses the file-level `set -e` on failure); the trailing
   `remote_log` line branches on rc — `complete` on 0, "timed out
   after Ns" on 124/137, "rc=N — continuing" on any other non-zero
   — so the launcher log honestly reports failure surface without
   aborting the run. Replaces shipping ~200 MB of plugin contents
   over the WireGuard pipe with ~30–90 s of public-egress git-clone
   + bun-install on the Fly machine.

Git-push auth (SSH keys, `.netrc`, `~/.config/gh`) is **not** seeded — that
auth lives on the host per DESIGN §6 *Finalization* and is not needed inside
the remote machine for `claude -p` worker authentication or `git commit`.
The host pushes the run branch via `leerie --finalize` after `fetch_branch`
streams the branch + state directory back; the machine never sees a
GitHub credential.

After seeding completes the launcher starts the orchestrator inside the
machine **detached** — see DESIGN §6 *Detached orchestrator (remote
mode)* for the rationale. The launcher generates the run-id host-side
(slug + suffix, same pattern as today's orchestrator-side generator)
and passes it explicitly via `--run-id <id>`, so it knows the
`orchestrator.log` path before the orchestrator has produced any output.
The detach is done by piping a Python wrapper script via stdin to
`flyctl ssh console -C "python3 -"`:

```bash
# Build the wrapper script host-side with the argv JSON literal
# embedded (so no remote shell quoting touches the orchestrator argv).
_launch_argv_json="$(python3 -c '

`--no-push` is always injected so the remote orchestrator's
`phase_finalize` does not attempt a push itself — the Fly Machine has
no GitHub auth and cannot push regardless of user intent. Push is the
host's responsibility, run inline by `decide_teardown` after
stream-back (see *Run branch stream-back* below) or — as a recovery
path — via `leerie --finalize <run-id>` after reattach.

**Intent vs mechanism.** The orchestrator must distinguish "the user
launched with `--no-push`" (intent) from "I am running on a Fly
Machine and physically cannot push" (mechanism). Both arrive as flags
on the orchestrator's argv:

- `--no-push` — the mechanism flag the launcher always passes on Fly.
- `--host-no-push true|false` — the intent flag the launcher
  *additionally* appends on Fly. The value is the launcher's resolved
  `$NO_PUSH` at machine-creation time (host_no_push in
  `fly-machine.json`).

`phase_finalize` gates `pr_writer` and the value it writes to
`run.json.no_push` on `push_will_happen(no_push, host_no_push)`:

```python
def push_will_happen(no_push: bool, host_no_push: bool | None) -> bool:
    if host_no_push is None:            # local runtime — no Fly Machine
        return not no_push
    return not host_no_push             # Fly — intent wins over mechanism
```

Without this split, `pr_writer` would be silently skipped on every
Fly run (because the mechanism flag silences it) and the LLM-written
PR body would always be replaced by the deterministic fallback.

When the tail's ssh-console session ends (the orchestrator wrote its
final log line and exited, or the user pressed Ctrl-C, or the laptop
disconnected), the launcher's EXIT trap classifies the rc via
`decide_teardown` per the table above — **sync-then-destroy** for
clean terminal exits (rc=0/10/75: `_try_fetch_branch_for_teardown` runs
`fetch_branch` BEFORE `destroy_machine`; on sync failure leaves the
machine RUNNING for user recovery), **detach** for SIGINT/SIGTERM,
**pause** for other non-zero rc.

**Pre-classify resume — `--resume` is host-only, task is recovered
from `task.txt`.** `leerie --resume` on the host means "wake the paused
Fly machine"; the in-machine orchestrator interprets the same flag as
"resume state from disk." Since the run-id is the machine ID from the
start (DESIGN §6), the launcher always has a valid run-id at resume time.
If classify never ran (no `state.json` exists), the orchestrator's
`--resume` branch needs a `task` positional, which is gone from the
user's resume argv. The launcher persists the user's original task
argument to `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/$LEERIE_RUN_ID/task.txt` on
first launch (the run dir already exists — `provision_machine()` wrote
`fly-machine.json` there first), and on pre-classify resume — when
`LEERIE_TASK_ARG` is empty in this invocation's argv — reads it back
and appends to `REWRITTEN_ARGS`. Both writes are idempotent (`! -f`
and "no task in argv" guards), so an explicit re-supplied task on the
resume command line wins. `task.txt` is launcher-side; the orchestrator
never reads it.

The launcher's task extractor walks `$@` once at startup, skipping
the value of any `--flag` that takes one. The list of value-taking
flags (`_value_flags` literal in `leerie`) is source-coupled to the
orchestrator's argparse by `tests/test_launcher_value_flags_coupling.py`
— a value-taker added upstream that is not mirrored in the launcher
would silently misclassify its value as the task and persist the wrong
string. Per-worker `--model-<W>` / `--effort-<W>` overrides are matched
by prefix pattern (`--model-*` / `--effort-*`) rather than enumerated.

Maps to `DESIGN.md` §6 (container boundary / teardown / finalization)
and §6 *Remote execution* (the one-microVM-per-run model and the
host-as-the-only-credential-holder contract).

#### Repo seeding (`scripts/remote/seed-repo.sh`)

Two-phase bundle-then-rsync seeding: the host has the full repo, so
pack its committed state as a `git bundle` and pipe it to the
machine; the machine clones from the bundle on its local disk; the
host then rsync's the small dirty/untracked delta to fill in
uncommitted edits, untracked files, and forced-in `.claude/`. No
in-machine `git clone` from origin — Fly machines deliberately receive
no GitHub credentials (DESIGN §6 *Finalization*: the host pushes via
`leerie --finalize`, not the machine).

**Phase 1: bundle clone (`seed_repo_clone`).**

1. **Parent repo bundle.** Host runs `git -C "$USER_REPO" bundle
   create - --all 2>/dev/null` and pipes the output stream straight to
   `flyctl ssh console --pty=false -C "sh -c 'cat > /tmp/leerie-seed.bundle'"`
   on the machine. `--all` packs every ref into one pack-format binary
   stream. The `sh -c '...'` wrapper is load-bearing — bare
   `-C "cat > /tmp/..."` is parsed by flyctl as if `>` were a `cat`
   argument and fails with `cat: invalid option -- 'c'`.

2. **Submodule bundles, recursive.** Host runs `git submodule --quiet
   foreach --recursive 'git bundle create - --all | flyctl ssh
   console -C "sh -c '\''cat > /tmp/leerie-subs/<flat-displaypath>.bundle'\''"'`
   so each submodule's pack data lands as its own file on the machine.
   The flat-displaypath name (`/` → `_`) gives unambiguous filenames
   for nested submodules.

3. **Machine-side clone + submodule update.** A single
   `flyctl ssh console -C "sh -c '<script>'"` call:
   - `git clone /tmp/leerie-seed.bundle /work` (treats the bundle file
     like a remote; recreates `.git/` and checks out HEAD).
   - For each submodule, `git config submodule.<name>.url
     /tmp/leerie-subs/<bn>.bundle` (sets the URL in `.git/config`, NOT
     `.gitmodules` — we never modify the committed file).
   - `git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule update --recursive`
     (clones each submodule from its bundle file). The
     `protocol.file.allow=always` flag is load-bearing — git 2.38+
     blocks the `file` protocol by default per CVE-2022-39253, which
     would otherwise abort the submodule clone with `fatal: transport
     'file' not allowed`.
   - `chown -R leerie: /work` (orchestrator runs as leerie).
   - `rm -rf /tmp/leerie-seed.bundle /tmp/leerie-subs` (bundles served
     their purpose; tmpfs space reclaimed).

Before the clone runs, `/work` is emptied via `find /work -mindepth 1
-maxdepth 1 -exec rm -rf {} +`. Note the `find ... -exec rm` form
preserves the `/work` inode itself — a naive `rm -rf /work && mkdir
-p /work` would replace the inode and leave any process holding a
prior fd (the ssh-console shell, the orchestrator about to be
spawned) with a stale cwd, producing `getcwd: ENOENT` cascades.

**Why bundles instead of tar (the previous mechanism):** macOS BSD
`tar -c` normalizes filenames NFC → NFD when archiving (libarchive
behavior). The Linux receiver wrote NFD bytes to disk; git's index
from macOS still held NFC bytes (because the index was built on
APFS, which normalizes at the syscall layer). Result: filenames
with `ó`, `ñ`, emoji, etc. showed as untracked + missing on the
machine, and a single such file inside a submodule made the parent
flag ` M`, failing preflight. Verified empirically on the live api
repo's `📄Plan de implementación.pdf` (NFC `c3 b3` on host → NFD
`6f cc 81` on machine after BSD tar transport). Bundles sidestep
the issue entirely because the bundle file stores pack-format
binary objects; filenames are materialized natively on the receiving
Linux git from raw bytes in tree objects — no transport-layer
normalization decision ever happens.

**Phase 2: dirty delta (`seed_repo_dirty`).** Same call path as
`re-seed.sh` (Phase 4 mid-run re-rsync) but called automatically by
`seed_repo` immediately after the bundle clone succeeds. Computes the
dirty set from `git status --porcelain` on the host:
- Modified-but-uncommitted tracked files
- Untracked-not-ignored files
- Defensive filter drops `.git/*`, non-whitelisted `.leerie/*` paths, and worktree paths
  (`.leerie/runs/*/worktrees/*`) before handing the list to rsync; exception: `.leerie/config.toml`,
  `.leerie/Dockerfile`, `.leerie/.leerie-setup.sh` pass through
- Forced-in `.claude/` (workers need it, often gitignored) —
  enumerated via `find .claude -type f` host-side and appended to
  the dirty list before the defensive filter

The dirty set is rsync'd over `flyctl ssh console -C "rsync --server
..."` via `fly_rsync_wrapper` (lib.sh). NFC byte preservation is
free with rsync; the bundle path doesn't need it (filenames don't
transit at all), but the delta does.

The script is **sourced** (not exec'd) by the launcher — the same
pattern as `provision.sh` — so `seed_repo()` runs in the launcher's
process after `provision_machine()` exports `$LEERIE_MACHINE_ID`.

Environment variables consumed by `seed-repo.sh`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LEERIE_MACHINE_ID` | — | ID of the started Fly Machine (exported by `provision.sh`) |
| `LEERIE_FLY_APP` | — (required) | Fly.io app name. Fly app names are globally unique; set via `--fly-app` or env. |
| `USER_REPO` | — | Absolute path to the local git repo (set by launcher) |

Requires: `flyctl` on `PATH` (authenticated); `git`; `python3`; `rsync`.

#### Run branch stream-back (`scripts/remote/fetch-branch.sh`)

Stream-back path that makes the completed run available on the host
so the existing host-side finalize block can push it and open a PR.
Runs in two contexts:

- **Sync-before-destroy** (the load-bearing safety net):
  `decide_teardown`'s clean-exit branch sources `fetch-branch.sh`
  via `_try_fetch_branch_for_teardown` and runs `fetch_branch`
  BEFORE calling `destroy_machine`. On sync failure the machine is
  left RUNNING with `sync_failed_at` written to the sidecar.
- **`leerie --finalize`** (user-driven recovery / re-attempt). The
  launcher's `--finalize` handler also detects "already synced to
  host" state and short-circuits past `fetch_branch` entirely. Two
  flavors qualify: (a) **normal run** — `finished_at` set, state.json
  present, AND the run branch exists locally (auto-sync's `git
  bundle` step landed); (b) **no-work run (DESIGN §8)** —
  `finished_at` set, state.json present, `run.json.no_push=true`, and
  the run branch was NEVER materialized (so it cannot exist locally).
  In flavor (b), `host_finalize`'s `no_push` gate short-circuits
  the push cleanly; its rev-parse defense-in-depth guard backstops
  the case where `no_push` was lost upstream.

The mechanism is the same in both contexts:

1. **Discover the completed run** — scans `.leerie/runs/*/run.json`
   on the machine via a python -c snippet through
   `flyctl ssh console -C`. The python script picks the entry
   with `finished_at` set, no `pushed_at`, and the most recent
   mtime, then prints four lines on stdout: run_id, branch,
   working_branch, no_push.

   CRITICAL: stderr is captured to a separate tmpfile, NOT
   merged into stdout via `2>&1`. `flyctl ssh console` prints
   "Connecting to fdaa:..." to stderr; merging it would shift
   every parsed line by one and corrupt the discovered run_id
   into the "Connecting to..." string, then the branch name
   becomes what should have been the run_id, etc. Downstream
   `git bundle create` would silently produce an empty bundle
   against a nonexistent branch.

2. **Probe branch existence** — `git -C /work rev-parse --verify
   refs/heads/<run_branch>` via ssh console. If the branch does
   not exist (the cleared-but-empty terminal-state case described
   in DESIGN §8 — the orchestrator exited cleanly because the
   task was already satisfied on HEAD; setup-run.sh never ran),
   skip step 3.

   We do NOT use the `no_push` flag from `run.json` as a proxy
   for "no branch was materialized." `no_push=true` is a
   *mechanism* flag the launcher always forces on the in-Fly
   orchestrator (the machine can't push), not a *user-intent*
   flag and not a "no branch" signal. The user's actual no-push
   intent lives in `fly-machine.json`'s `host_no_push`.

3. **Run branch via git bundle** — `git -C /work bundle create -
   leerie/runs/<run-id>` on the machine, piped to a host tempfile,
   then fetched via `git fetch <bundle> +<branch>:<branch>` into
   the host repo. The bundle resolves cleanly because both repos
   share the same origin history.

4. **Run state directory** — tars `/work/.leerie/runs/<run-id>`
   on the machine and extracts it under `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/`
   on the host. After extraction, `run.json` and `state.json`
   are present on the host exactly as they would be after a
   local run.

5. **Strip mechanism `no_push` from synced run.json — conditional
   on branch presence.** After the tar extracts, if a run branch
   was actually fetched in step 3 AND the host-side run.json has
   `no_push=true`, remove the field. This is defense against
   in-flight old-image runs that wrote the mechanism flag; the
   user's intent is stored elsewhere (see
   `fly-machine.json.host_no_push`).

   When step 2's branch probe returned absent (the cleared-but-empty
   terminal-state case — DESIGN §8), the stripper is **skipped**.
   `_finish_no_work_run` deliberately writes `no_push=true` to
   `run.json` as **intent** ("nothing to push — no branch exists"),
   and `host_finalize`'s `no_push` gate reads that intent to
   short-circuit cleanly (the rev-parse defense-in-depth guard is
   a backstop for the same case). Stripping `no_push` here would
   disarm the gate; host_finalize would fall through to the
   rev-parse guard and still return cleanly, but the on-disk
   run.json would no longer reflect the orchestrator's intent.

The script is **sourced** (not exec'd) by the launcher and exports
`LEERIE_REMOTE_RUN_ID` on success (the discovered run-id, in case the caller
needs it for diagnostics).

Environment variables consumed by `fetch-branch.sh`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LEERIE_MACHINE_ID` | — | ID of the started Fly Machine (exported by `provision.sh`) |
| `LEERIE_FLY_APP` | — (required) | Fly.io app name. Fly app names are globally unique; set via `--fly-app` or env. |
| `USER_REPO` | — | Absolute path to the local git repo (set by launcher) |

Exports: `LEERIE_REMOTE_RUN_ID` — the run-id of the completed run on the machine.

Requires: `flyctl` on `PATH` (authenticated); `git`; `tar`; `python3` (on the machine — always present in the leerie image).

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §6 *Finalization* (remote-finalize stream-back variant).

#### Smart resume (`leerie --resume`)

`leerie --resume [<run-id>] [--shell] [--auto-finalize]
[--app <app>] [--runtime fly]` re-engages with a remote run regardless
of state. The launcher routes by observation:

| Machine state | Orchestrator state | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Stopped (paused) | n/a | Wake via `resume_machine` → re-seed → launch orchestrator → tail |
| Running | Dead | (Re-)seed if needed → launch orchestrator → tail |
| Running | Alive | Skip seed + launch → attach: tail orchestrator.log (default) or open bash shell (`--shell`) |

The "alive orchestrator" case is detected by a two-layered flock probe.
**Early probe (resume path only):** on the `_resumed=true` path, the
launcher runs a lightweight Python flock snippet via `flyctl ssh console`
immediately after `resume_machine` — before `seed_auth`. If the probe
returns rc=75 (lock held), the launcher skips `seed_auth`, `re_seed`,
and the launch wrapper entirely, pivoting straight to
`_attach_to_live_orchestrator` (lib.sh). SSH readiness is not a concern:
when the orchestrator is alive, the machine was never stopped and
hallpass is already warm; if the probe fails for any non-75 reason, the
launcher falls through to `seed_auth`. **Launch-time probe
(belt-and-suspenders):** the launcher's in-machine Python launch
wrapper takes a fast-path flock probe (DESIGN §6 *Single owner per run
dir*) and exits 75 when the run-directory lock is held. This covers
fresh provisions and any race the early probe missed. Because `flyctl
ssh console` does not forward remote exit codes (see
§Single-owner-per-run-dir enforcement, *flyctl exit-code workaround*),
the launcher parses the real code from stderr via
`_extract_flyctl_remote_rc`. Both probes pivot via
`_attach_to_live_orchestrator` (lib.sh): it invokes
`tail_with_optional_autofinalize()` (default) or a `flyctl ssh console`
bash payload (`--shell`) against the live machine, and sets
`container_rc=130` so `decide_teardown` leaves the machine alone. The
attach transport is `flyctl ssh console` proxied through Fly's
hallpass + WireGuard mesh — no sshd in the image, no key management,
no public exposure. Auth inherits from `flyctl auth status`.

Run-id resolution:

1. `leerie --resume <id>` → look up
   `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<id>/fly-machine.json` first, then
   `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<id>/run.json` (which carries
   `fly_machine_id` per Phase 2). If neither yields a value, exit
   with the per-id "no Fly machine pointer found" error.
2. `leerie --resume` (no run-id) → scan
   `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/remote/*.json` for active records (records
   whose filename is a launcher PID that still exists). Exactly one
   → resolve the run-id from the record and continue. Multiple →
   print the list and exit 1. None → fall through to the existing
   per-id "no Fly machine pointer found" error path.

`provision.sh` writes the PID-keyed record at
`$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/remote/$$.json` immediately after creating the
machine, and also writes the run-keyed pointer
`$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/$LEERIE_REMOTE_RUN_ID/fly-machine.json`
in the same call — before returning to the launcher — so `--resume`
survives a Ctrl-C between `provision_machine()` returning and the
launcher's deferred copy. `destroy_machine` removes the PID-keyed
record on full reap. The launcher's copy (guarded by `[ ! -f ]`) is a
no-op fallback for compatibility with older images.

Schema for the record (both paths):

```json
{
  "fly_app": "my-leerie-app",
  "fly_machine_id": "148e445b911389",
  "started_at": "2026-05-29T16:00:00+00:00",
  "run_id": "feat-foo-abc123",
  "launcher_pid": 12345
}
```

Sub-mode flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| (default) | Tail `/work/.leerie/runs/<run-id>/orchestrator.log` via `render_tail_wrapper`. Ctrl-C detaches without affecting the orchestrator. |
| `--shell` | Open a bash shell at `/work` with `$PS1` set to `leerie@<run-id>:\w$` (the orchestrator runs unaffected in the background). |
| `--auto-finalize` | On clean orchestrator exit (alive→dead during tail), automatically `exec leerie --finalize <run-id>` on the host. Plumbed via `tail_with_optional_autofinalize` and the `AUTO_FINALIZE_TOKEN` sentinel emitted by `render_tail_wrapper`. |

Both flags are launcher-only — the filter loop strips them from
`REWRITTEN_ARGS` before exec into the orchestrator (same convention as
`--no-re-seed`, `--no-runtime-install`).

Local-runtime `--resume` is unaffected by this smart router. Local
runs are synchronous foreground processes (`nerdctl run --rm` with no
backgrounding), so there is no detached container to attach to; local
`--resume` keeps its existing inline-re-exec behavior. The smart
router branches live inside the `RUNTIME=fly` guard.

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §6 *Smart resume in remote mode*.

#### Mid-run re-rsync (`scripts/remote/re-seed.sh`)

Two user-visible surfaces share one mechanism:

1. **`leerie --re-seed <run-id> [--force]`** — explicit fast-path
   before runtime preflight. Wakes the machine if stopped, runs the
   safety check, runs `seed_repo_dirty`, exits. No orchestrator
   exec — for the case where the user wants to attach via Phase 3
   to inspect before resuming.
2. **Auto-re-seed on `leerie --resume <run-id> --runtime fly`** —
   inside the `RUNTIME=fly` branch, when `resume_machine` runs
   (i.e., the dual-file resolver — `fly-machine.json` first, then
   `run.json` — yielded a `fly_machine_id` for the run-id), the
   launcher calls `re_seed` between `seed_auth` and the orchestrator
   exec. `--no-re-seed` opts out (rate-limit case where nothing
   changed host-side). `--force` bypasses the safety check.

   The dispatch is strict on `--resume`: if no machine pointer is
   found in either sidecar, the launcher dies with a diagnostic
   pointing at `leerie --list` rather than silently provisioning a
   fresh machine (which would orphan the original on Fly). Likewise,
   if `resume_machine` returns non-zero (machine destroyed or
   unstart-able), the launcher exits with the failure instead of
   falling through to `provision_machine`. Without `--resume`,
   behavior is unchanged — fresh runs always provision.

Three operations in `re_seed`, in order:

1. **Wake the machine if needed.** `flyctl machine status` → if
   `stopped`, `flyctl machine start` + `wait_for_started`. Other
   states (`destroyed`, `replacing`, …) abort with an actionable
   message.
2. **Safety check (unless `LEERIE_RE_SEED_FORCE=1`).** Run
   `flyctl machine exec git -C /work status --porcelain` and filter
   out paths under `.leerie/` (worker state is expected to change
   there). If any tracked file is dirty, refuse with a message
   listing the first 10 paths and pointing at `leerie --resume
   <run-id> --shell` and the `--force` bypass. Prevents silent
   clobbering of in-flight worker edits that haven't yet been
   committed to a per-subtask branch.
3. **`seed_repo_dirty`.** Recompute the host's `git status
   --porcelain` dirty set, append every file under the repo-local
   `.claude/` directory (force-included even when gitignored — workers
   need its hooks/agents/skills/commands), filter the combined list
   (drop `.git/*`, non-whitelisted `.leerie/*` paths, and `.leerie/runs/*/worktrees/*` defensive
   entries), then rsync the result to `/work` on the machine via
   `fly_rsync_wrapper` from `lib.sh` (transports `rsync --server` over
   `flyctl ssh console -C`). The full-history clone on the machine is
   preserved — re-seed must never re-clone, because that would
   obliterate the run branch and per-subtask branches.

Launcher flag consumption:

| Flag | Env | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--no-re-seed` | — | off | Skip the auto-re-seed during `--resume`. |
| `--force` | `LEERIE_RE_SEED_FORCE=1` | off | Bypass the safety check that refuses re-seed against machine-side dirty tracked files. |

Both flags are consumed by the launcher and not forwarded to the
orchestrator (same convention as `--no-runtime-install`,
`--no-auto-publish`).

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §6 *Mid-run re-seed (remote mode)*.

#### Explicit pause and destroy verbs (`leerie --stop`, `leerie --kill`)

The detached orchestrator (DESIGN §6 *Detached orchestrator (remote
mode)*) decouples the user's local terminal from the run's lifetime.
Ctrl-C no longer means "destroy" — it means "stop watching." So the
destructive and pause actions need explicit verbs.

Two new launcher flags, routed at the top of `leerie` alongside
`--resume` (line ~63):

- **`leerie --stop <run-id>`** — clean pause. Runtime detection:
  (1) `_auto_detect_fly_runtime` checks for `fly-machine.json` →
  Fly path; (2) `_is_local_container` probes `nerdctl inspect
  <run-id>` → local path; (3) neither → error.
  - **Fly path:** sources `provision.sh`, exports `LEERIE_MACHINE_ID`
    and `FLY_APP`, calls `stop_machine()`.
  - **Local path:** sources `lib.sh`, calls `nerdctl stop <run-id>`
    (SIGTERM first — the orchestrator's `InterruptedBySignal` handler
    saves state before exit — then SIGKILL after grace period; `--rm`
    on the original `nerdctl run` auto-removes the container).
  - Both paths call `update_run_json` to set `paused_at = <iso_now>`
    and `pause_reason = "user-requested"` on the sidecar. The run is
    resumable via `leerie --resume <id>`.
- **`leerie --kill <run-id> [--force]`** — destroy. Same runtime
  detection as `--stop`. Prompts the user to type the run-id to
  confirm (unless `--force` / `LEERIE_FORCE_KILL=1`).
  - **Fly path:** calls `destroy_machine()`, sets `killed_at` and
    `fly_machine_id` on the sidecar.
  - **Local path:** calls `nerdctl kill <run-id>` (immediate SIGKILL),
    sets `killed_at` on the sidecar.
  - The run is no longer resumable.

  Recovery path for the orphan case: `leerie --kill --machine-id <id>
  --app <app>` allows destruction by machine-id directly when the
  sidecar is missing or unreadable (e.g., `.leerie/` was deleted but
  the machine is still running on Fly). This path is Fly-only.

Both verbs route before any runtime preflight (fast-path dispatch)
and exit without ever sourcing `seed-auth.sh` / `seed-repo.sh`. The
Fly path calls `require_flyctl` from `lib.sh`; the local path only
sources `lib.sh` (for `update_run_json` / `iso_now`). Both are
read-only with respect to the local repo (except for the sidecar
update).

The `killed_at` field is added to `RUN_STATUSES` in `orchestrator/leerie.py`
as a new terminal state (`killed`); `_derive_run_status` reads it
before `paused_at`. `_validate_run_json` enforces that `paused_at`,
`pushed_at`, and `killed_at` are mutually exclusive (same invariant
pattern as today's `paused_at` vs `pushed_at`).

#### Completion gate (`incomplete` status + finalize refusal)

DESIGN §6 *`finished_at` is a discovery sentinel, not a completion
signal*. Because `main()`'s `except SystemExit` handler stamps
`finished_at` on any post-setup `die()` (needed for `fetch_branch`
discovery), `finished_at` does not by itself mean the run's waves all
integrated. A run OOM-killed mid-wave can carry `finished_at` with
`completed_waves < len(waves)`. Three code-surface elements gate on real
completion, all reading the same signal from `state.json` (`run.json`
never carries `completed_waves`/`waves`):

- **`_derive_run_status`** takes `state_json` (already passed) and, when
  `finished_at` is set but `completed_waves < len(state_json["waves"])`
  and neither `killed_at` nor `paused_at` is set, returns the new status
  `incomplete` instead of `done`/`done-pushed-*`. The check fires after
  the push/PR-error checks (a real push/PR error still surfaces as
  itself) but before the `finished_at`→`done` check. `incomplete` is
  added to the derived-status set and is a valid `--list --status`
  filter value. The cleared-but-empty terminal state
  (`no_work_required`, `waves == []`) is exempt — `completed_waves (0)
  < len([]) (0)` is false, so it still reads `done`. This gates only the
  `--list` *display*, not the push.
- **`phase_finalize`** guards its entry: if
  `completed_waves < len(waves)`, it `die()`s with a "refusing to
  finalize: N of M waves complete" message rather than writing the real
  `finished_at`. Belt-and-suspenders — the normal wave loop only reaches
  `phase_finalize` after all waves integrate (the no-work path returns
  before it), but a stray finalize-only invocation is blocked here. Note
  this is the *in-container* orchestrator; it does not itself push.
- **`host_finalize`** (`scripts/host-finalize.sh`) is the **load-bearing
  gate**, because the push+PR is host-side. After the `no_push` and
  `pushed_at` early-returns, it reads `$run_dir/state.json` (already in
  scope for the PR-body fallback) and `return 1`s with an actionable
  resume hint when `no_work_required != true` and `completed_waves <
  (.waves | length)`. All three host-side push entry points funnel
  through `host_finalize` — the launcher's auto-finalize block
  (`leerie`), the `leerie --finalize <id>` verb, and Fly's
  `decide_teardown` (`scripts/remote/provision.sh`) — so this one gate
  covers them all. Fail-open: absent/non-numeric wave fields skip the
  gate so a legitimately complete run is never blocked over a missing
  file. Without this gate, `_derive_run_status` and `phase_finalize`
  alone would still let a stray `--finalize` push a partial branch (the
  PR-#22 incident).

#### Accept-blocked verb (`leerie --accept-blocked`)

When a subtask returns `status: blocked` due to unsatisfied `extent:
external` prerequisites (DESIGN §5), `--resume` retries it — which
blocks again indefinitely. The `--accept-blocked` verb lets the
operator acknowledge the external block so `--resume` skips that
subtask.

- **`leerie --accept-blocked <run-id> <subtask-id> [--runtime fly|local]`**
  — sets `subtask_status[sid]` to `"complete"` in state.json and removes
  the sid from the `blocked` dict (if present). On `--resume`,
  `phase_execute`'s wave-skip filters subtasks whose `subtask_status` is
  `"complete"`, so the accepted subtask never re-dispatches.
  - **Input validation (both runtimes):** both positionals are checked
    against `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` immediately after parsing, before they
    reach any filesystem path or remote shell. The run-id is interpolated
    into the host state-dir path (traversal risk) and, on Fly, into the
    `flyctl ssh console -C` string; the sid is interpolated into that same
    `-C` string. Since `-C` is parsed by a **remote shell**, an unvalidated
    metacharacter would be a command-injection vector (SECURITY.md); the
    allowlist is the mechanical enforcement (DESIGN §12).
  - **Local path:** runs the mutation program (`python3 -c "$_ab_mutate"`)
    against `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<id>/state.json` directly
    (bind-mounted into containers).
  - **Fly path:** inspects `flyctl machine status`; refuses on
    `destroyed`/missing; if `stopped`, wakes the machine (`flyctl machine
    start` + `wait_for_started`, fatal on failure) and records that it did
    so. Waits for hallpass via `wait_for_fly_ssh_ready "$FLY_APP"
    "$machine_id"` (gated on the return). Pipes the mutation program over
    **stdin** to `python3 -` on the machine (`printf '%s' "$_ab_mutate" |
    flyctl ssh console ... -C "python3 - '<remote-state>' '<sid>'"`) so the
    multi-line script body never round-trips through a shell quoter (same
    idiom as `force-finalize.sh`). The `-C` string itself IS parsed by a
    remote shell, so the two positional args are single-quoted and the
    run-id/sid inside them are the validated tokens above. The program
    prints an `ACCEPTED:` / `NOOP:` / `ERROR:` sentinel that the launcher
    greps (flyctl flattens the remote exit code). The host-side copy is
    mirrored best-effort. Teardown is **conditional**: the machine is
    paused again (with `paused_at`/`pause_reason`/`fly_machine_id`
    re-written via `update_run_json`) only if this verb woke a stopped
    machine — a machine that was already running is left running.
  - The mutation program validates that the subtask's current status is
    `"blocked"` or `"failed"` before mutating (atomic temp-file +
    `os.replace`). No-ops with a `NOOP:` sentinel if already `"complete"`.
  - **Test coverage:** `tests/test_accept_blocked.py` — local-path tests
    (mutation, no-op, error paths, blocked-dict cleanup), Fly-path tests
    with a stubbed `flyctl` that parses both `-C` positionals and routes
    the stdin-piped `python3 -` to a local fixture, and injection-rejection
    tests asserting a metacharacter-bearing run-id/sid is refused with a
    nonzero exit and no mutation.

prerequisites*, *Accepting external-blocked subtasks*.

user-visible verb surface*.

#### Unified `leerie --list` (cost column + `--status` + `--runtime` filters)

`list_runs()` in `orchestrator/leerie.py` is extended to surface remote
runs alongside local runs in a single table. Status and runtime are
**orthogonal axes**: status describes lifecycle (`paused`, `killed`,
`done`, `sync-failed`, `in-progress`, `done-pushed-pr`,
`done-pushed-no-pr`, `push-failed`, `pr-failed`, `corrupt-sidecar`,
`seed-failed`); runtime describes where the run executed (`local` or
`fly`). The `seed-failed` status covers run dirs that have a
`fly-machine.json` (launcher wrote it the moment Fly provision
succeeded) but no `state.json` (the orchestrator never wrote one,
typically because `seed_auth` aborted before `phase_classify`).
`discover_runs()` synthesizes a row dict with `_orphan=True` and
`started_at` from the fly sidecar; `_derive_run_status()` returns
`seed-failed` for them (earliest precedence, before the run.json
corrupt-sidecar check). `resolve_run_id()` accepts orphan ids
transitively (no special-casing needed once `discover_runs` returns
them), so `./leerie --resume <orphan-id> --runtime fly` works against a
seed-failed run.

Changes:

- `_collect_run_rows()` returns a per-run tuple
  `(run_id, started_at, status, branch, is_fly, cost)`. `is_fly` is a
  bool derived from `fly_machine_id` in `run.json` or a present
  `fly-machine.json` — it is **filter-only** (consumed by the
  `--runtime` filter), never rendered as a column. `cost` is the run's
  aggregate `$X.XX` from `state.json`'s `telemetry.cost_usd` (present
  in the state summary `discover_runs` passes through — no extra disk
  read), or `—` when telemetry is absent (orphans / pre-classify runs).
- `_render_run_table()` renders columns in the order `run_id,
  started_at, status, cost, branch` (the filter-only `is_fly` is not a
  column). The `cost` column is right-aligned; widths auto-size.
- `--status <state>` argparse flag on `--list` filters rows to only
  those whose derived status matches. `<state>` accepts any value in
  `RUN_STATUSES` (see list above). Invalid values produce an
  argparse error listing the allowed set.
- `--list --runtime fly` is intercepted by the launcher (bash) before
  the orchestrator dispatch and queries Fly directly via `flyctl
  machines list --app <FLY_APP> --json`. Renders a `machine_id |
  state | region | created_at | run_id (local)` table covering every
  machine under the app, regardless of which host repo launched them.
  `run_id` is best-effort filled by scanning `<state-root>/runs/*/{fly-
  machine.json,run.json}` for the current repo; machines launched from
  another repo show `run_id=?`. Falls back to the orchestrator-side
  local-sidecar list when `flyctl` is missing or auth fails. Plain
  `--list` (no `--runtime fly`) is unchanged.

Verbs `--stop`, `--kill`, `--finalize` accept an optional
`--runtime <local|fly>` flag. `--stop` and `--kill` support both
runtimes: Fly runs route to `flyctl machine stop`/`flyctl machine
destroy`; local runs route to `nerdctl stop`/`nerdctl kill` via the
`_is_local_container` probe (`nerdctl inspect <run-id>`). `--stop`
uses `nerdctl stop` (SIGTERM first, allowing graceful state save);
`--kill` uses `nerdctl kill` (immediate SIGKILL). `--finalize
--runtime local` still errors — local finalization is inline. Without
the flag, the verbs infer the runtime from the sidecar
(`fly-machine.json` presence for Fly, `nerdctl inspect` for local).
`--resume` accepts `--runtime` directly (the smart router branches by
runtime: fly takes the smart-attach path, local takes the inline
re-exec path).

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §6 *The user-visible verb surface*.

#### Detached run finalization (`leerie --finalize <run-id>`)

With the detached orchestrator, the launcher cannot synchronously wait
for orchestrator completion and call `fetch_branch` — the tail's exec
session ends before (or independent of) the orchestrator's actual exit.
Two surfaces address this together:

1. **`orchestrator.pid` on the machine.** The detached-launch sh wrapper
   records the orchestrator's pid in
   `/work/.leerie/runs/<run-id>/orchestrator.pid` after the post-`Popen`
   poll has cleared the flock-loser case (see the launcher
   `_launch_script` listing above and DESIGN §6 *Single owner per
   run dir*). `leerie --resume`'s in-machine tail watcher checks
   liveness via two ORed signals — pid-file `kill -0` and a
   `/proc/[0-9]*/cmdline` scan for `orchestrator/leerie.py` + run-id
   — alongside the `tail -F`. Both must agree the orchestrator is
   dead before the watcher prints
   `<ISO-8601> [leerie] remote: orchestrator exited — syncing run branch + state to host...`.
   The tail then exits. The `/proc` scan is what closes the
   stale-pid contagion described in DESIGN §6: even if the pid file
   went stale (concurrent-spawn race, future cause), the scan finds
   the real orchestrator and the watcher keeps tailing.
2. **`leerie --finalize <run-id>`** — new launcher fast-path that runs the
   post-orchestrator block the launcher used to run inline: source
   `fetch-branch.sh`, call `fetch_branch`, source the host-side
   finalize block (push + `gh pr create`). The verb is idempotent — if
   the run branch is already pushed (`pushed_at` set), it short-
   circuits with "already finalized."

**`leerie --finalize` resolves the run-id directly.** The launcher
resolves `<run-id>` against `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<run-id>/`
locally to pick up `fly-machine.json` and the partial sidecar. Since
the run-id IS the machine ID (DESIGN §6), no fallback lookup is
needed. No-match falls through to an error augmented with a hint to
run `leerie --list`.

**`leerie --finalize <run-id>`** (non-force) first tries
`fetch_branch` (the normal clean-exit case: orchestrator wrote
`finished_at`). If that fails, the launcher auto-recovers: it calls
`force_finalize_remote` (which checks whether the orchestrator is dead
and patches `finished_at` — see liveness checks below), then
`collect_subtrees_remote` to integrate un-merged subtask branches on
the machine, then retries `fetch_branch`. If the orchestrator is still
alive, the launcher refuses with a hint to use `--force`.

**`leerie --finalize <run-id> --force`** extends the recovery to runs
where the orchestrator is still alive. The launcher calls
`force_finalize_remote` with `FORCE_STOP=1`, which SIGTERMs the
orchestrator process *inside the machine* (the process, NOT the
machine — the machine must stay running for the subsequent collection
and fetch steps), waits for it to die (polling `/proc`; escalates to
SIGKILL after 30 s), patches `finished_at`, then falls through.
The launcher then calls `collect_subtrees_remote` and `fetch_branch`.

**Liveness checks** (`scripts/remote/force-finalize.sh`):

1. Lists `/work/.leerie/runs/` for the single run dir
   (fails clearly on multi-match).
2. Reads `run.json`; if `finished_at` is already set, no-op (idempotent).
3. Checks orchestrator liveness via two complementary signals:
   - `/proc` cross-check (authoritative): scan `/proc/[0-9]*/cmdline`
     for any process whose NUL-separated argv contains both the
     literal string `orchestrator/leerie.py` AND the run-id. If
     found → orchestrator alive → **REFUSE-ALIVE-SCAN** (or
     **STOPPED** if `FORCE_STOP=1`).
   - `orchestrator.pid` check (defensive, kept for pid-reuse audit):
     - Pid file present + `kill -0 <pid>` succeeds + `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`
       contains `python` → orchestrator alive → **REFUSE-ALIVE** (or
       **STOPPED** if `FORCE_STOP=1`). (`cmdline` not `comm`
       because `comm` is the basename of the script-launcher binary —
       for a pip-installed `pytest` shim it is `"pytest"`, which does
       not contain `"python"` and would let an alive orchestrator
       slip through the guard. `cmdline` is the full execve argv,
       which always names the interpreter explicitly.)
     - Pid file present + `kill -0` fails (`ESRCH`) + `/proc` scan
       also empty → orchestrator dead; safe to proceed.
     - Pid file missing → refuse; tell the user to inspect manually
       via `leerie --resume <run-id> --shell --runtime fly`.

   The `/proc` scan exists because `orchestrator.pid` is not a
   reliable liveness oracle on its own: the launcher writes it
   *between* `Popen` and the child's `State.__init__`, so a
   stillborn flock-loser stamps its dead pid before the winner can
   claim authority (see DESIGN §6 *Single owner per run dir* —
   stale-pid contagion). The pid-file branch is retained because
   when it speaks (pid-reuse + matching cmdline) it is more precise
   than the scan, and a `REFUSE-ALIVE` distinct from
   `REFUSE-ALIVE-SCAN` makes the source of the refusal observable
   in audit logs.
4. Patches `run.json` in-place with `finished_at = <now>`,
   `no_push = false`, `recovered_at = <now>`,
   `recovered_via = "force-finalize"`, and falls through to the normal
   `fetch_branch` flow.

Sentinels: `OK:<run_id>`, `STOPPED:<run_id>:<pid>` (killed then
patched), `STOP-FAILED:<run_id>:<pid>`, `REFUSE-ALIVE-SCAN:*`,
`REFUSE-ALIVE:*`, `REFUSE-NOPID:*`, `REFUSE-MULTI:*`, `REFUSE-NONE`,
`ERROR:*`.

**Subtree collection** (`scripts/remote/collect-subtrees.sh`):
`collect_subtrees_remote` SSHes a bash payload that discovers
un-integrated subtask branches on the machine and merges them into the
run branch via `setup-run.sh` (idempotent) + `integrate.sh`.
Conflicts are resolved by spawning `claude -p` with the integrator
prompt and schema (same invocation as `integrate_wave()` in the
orchestrator). The integrator runs in the staging worktree with the
merge left in-progress. On success, the merge commit is verified
(`MERGE_HEAD` must not exist, no staged-but-uncommitted changes). On
failure, the merge is aborted and the branch is skipped. Wave ordering from
`state.json` is used when available (earlier waves first); falls back
to alphabetical. Sentinels: `COLLECTED-ALL:<run_id>:<count>`,
`COLLECTED:<run_id>:<integrated>:<skipped>:<skipped_sids>`,
`COLLECTED-NONE:<run_id>`, `COLLECT-ERROR:<message>`.

The synthesized audit fields (`recovered_at`, `recovered_via`) preserve
provenance of forced recoveries so post-mortems can distinguish them
from naturally-finalized runs.

`--finalize` logs the action it took before SSHing in:
`finalize: machine=<id> run=<id> action=<fetch|force-stop+collect+fetch|already-synced>`
so post-mortems of future failures are shorter.

This matches the convention that destructive and side-effecting actions
are explicit verbs (DESIGN §6 *The user-visible verb surface*) rather
than implicit consequences of stream timing.

Optional convenience: `leerie --resume <run-id> --auto-finalize`
runs `leerie --finalize` automatically when the pid-watch detects
clean exit, for users who want zero-touch finalization when they
happen to be watching. The same plumbing also applies to the
fresh-launch tail (`leerie "task" --runtime fly --auto-finalize`).

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §6 *Detached orchestrator (remote mode)*,
*Finalization* (recovery sub-paragraph).

#### Chain orchestration (cross-reference)

The chain orchestration code surface is documented in
[**§7 *Chain verbs***](#chain-verbs) earlier in this file (the launcher
verbs, coordinator endpoints, state schema, and worker-side hooks).
DESIGN.md §19 holds the architecture rationale.

## 8. Coordination directory layout

State lives under the resolved state root — by default
`$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`, or the path set via `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` /
`--state-dir` / `leerie.toml state_dir` (see §2 *State directory* for the
full resolution order). The state root is always outside the target repo,
so no `.leerie/` directory accumulates in project checkouts and no
`.gitignore` entry is needed. Worktrees are
disposable; the coordination directory outlives them.

Every run's artifacts live under `<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/`. The state
root is otherwise empty of run data; it only hosts the `runs/` directory.
Two concurrent runs in the same repository share no coordination state.

```
<state-root>/          (default: $HOME/.leerie/<basename>/)
                        also contains: .owner (sidecar — abs_path of the owning repo)

The `<run-id>` is the container/machine ID assigned by the container
runtime at creation time (DESIGN §6). There is no temporary directory
or rename step — the run directory is created with its final name from
the start.

`run.json` fields (a minimal sidecar enabling `leerie --list` and resume
discovery without parsing the full `state.json`):

| Field | Shape | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `run_id` | str | the run identifier (matches the directory name and the branch suffix) |
| `branch` | str | the run branch — always `leerie/runs/<run_id>` |
| `working_branch` | str | the branch HEAD-at-run-start; used as the PR base (leerie does not merge into it locally) |
| `started_at` | ISO-8601 str | wall-clock start time (also mirrored in `state.json`) |
| `finished_at` | ISO-8601 str \| null | wall-clock end time. Set at finalize success on the normal path; also set by the `except SystemExit` handler in `main()` for `die()` exits that fire after the run directory exists (on Fly, the tail wrapper propagates the orchestrator's exit code via `orchestrator.exit_code` when present, falling back to 0 when absent; either way `fetch_branch`'s discovery script needs `finished_at` to find the run). Idempotent on `--resume` — `phase_finalize` overwrites it with the real completion time if the run succeeds on retry. |
| `task` | str | the task description (mirrored from `state.json`) |
| `pushed_at` | ISO-8601 str \| null | when the run branch was pushed to `origin`; null until push runs |
| `push_error` | str \| null | captured `git push` stderr if the push failed; mutually exclusive with `pushed_at` being set |
| `pr_url` | str \| null | the PR URL `gh` returned; null until PR creation succeeds |
| `pr_error` | str \| null | captured `gh` stderr if PR creation failed; logical invariant — `pr_error` can be set only after `pushed_at` is set |
| `fly_machine_id` | str \| null | Fly Machine ID for a remote (`--runtime fly`) run; written by `scripts/remote/provision.sh` immediately after `flyctl machine run` succeeds, so a launcher that crashes before classifying still leaves a recoverable pointer. Null for local runs. |
| `paused_at` | ISO-8601 str \| null | when the remote run was paused — either on failure (set by the launcher's EXIT trap on the pause branch) or by explicit user request (`leerie --stop <run-id>`). Null for successful runs, killed runs, and runs the user merely detached from. **Cleared at finalize**: `fetch_branch`'s `tar -xC` (scripts/remote/fetch-branch.sh:225) overwrites the host sidecar with the machine's `run.json`, which has no `paused_at` set because the machine isn't aware of the user's pause action. Intentional — the post-finalize status should be `done-pushed-pr`, not `paused`. Pause/resume forensics are not preserved across finalize. |
| `pause_reason` | str \| null | short tag identifying which path set `paused_at` (`worker-error`, `orchestrator-exception`, `finalize-failed`, `user-requested`). Null when `paused_at` is null. Cleared with `paused_at` at finalize (see above). |
| `killed_at` | ISO-8601 str \| null | when the remote run was explicitly destroyed by `leerie --kill <run-id>`. The Fly Machine has been destroyed and the run is no longer resumable. Null for any other terminal state. |
| `sync_failed_at` | ISO-8601 str \| null | when the clean-exit branch of `decide_teardown` ran `fetch_branch` and it failed. The orchestrator finished cleanly on the machine, but the run branch + state directory could not be pulled back to the host. The machine is LEFT RUNNING (not stopped) so the user can recover manually via `leerie --finalize --runtime fly` (retry sync + push), `leerie --resume --runtime fly` (inspect — tails the log by default, `--shell` opens a bash session), or `leerie --kill --runtime fly` (destroy only after work is safely on host). Orthogonal to `paused_at`/`pushed_at`/`killed_at` — the machine is neither paused nor destroyed. Mutex-checked against `pushed_at` (a successfully pushed run can't be sync-failed) and `killed_at` (a destroyed machine can't be sync-failed). Requires `fly_machine_id` to be set (the running machine needs a pointer). |
| `sync_fail_reason` | str \| null | short tag accompanying `sync_failed_at` (currently always `sync-failed-on-clean-exit`). Null when `sync_failed_at` is null. |
| `recovered_at` | ISO-8601 str \| null | when `leerie --finalize <run-id> --force` patched this run's `finished_at` after the orchestrator died before its natural finalize. Set by `scripts/remote/force-finalize.sh` together with `finished_at` and `no_push=false`. A non-null value means the run reached host-side finalize via the recovery path rather than the natural one. Orthogonal to all terminal-state fields. Written **once** on the first successful `--force` run; subsequent `--force` invocations short-circuit on the now-set `finished_at` and leave `recovered_at` unchanged (the recovery timestamp records the original recovery, not the most recent verb invocation). |
| `recovered_via` | str \| null | short tag accompanying `recovered_at`; currently always `"force-finalize"`. Null when `recovered_at` is null. |
| `volume_id` | str \| null | Fly volume ID (e.g. `vol_…`) when the machine was provisioned with a volume (the default on `--runtime fly` since `FLY_VM_DISK_GB` defaults to `8`). Mounted at `/work` on the machine (the path that holds the seeded repo, `.leerie/runs/<id>/` state, and per-subtask worktrees). Destroyed when the machine is destroyed (clean exit or `leerie --kill`). Null for local-runtime runs or legacy Fly runs created before the default was introduced. If non-null, `fly_machine_id` must also be non-null — a volume without a machine to attach it to is invalid (enforced by `_validate_run_json`). |
| `image_tag` | str \| null | Full Fly registry image tag (e.g. `registry.fly.io/leerie:0.6.7`) recorded at provision time. Used by `resume_machine()` to detect version drift: if the current `$FLY_IMAGE_TAG` differs from the stored value (or the stored value is absent), the machine's image is updated via `flyctl machine update --image --skip-start` before starting. Updated in place on successful image update. Null for local-runtime runs or legacy Fly runs provisioned before the field was introduced (legacy machines always get the update on resume since empty != current). |
| `pr_title` | str \| null | LLM-written PR title from the `pr_writer` worker (omits the `leerie: ` prefix — the launcher prepends it before `gh pr create`). Null when the worker errored, was skipped because the user opted out of pushing (`push_will_happen(no_push, host_no_push)` is False — local `--no-push` or Fly `host_no_push=true`), or had not yet run; `host_finalize` uses its deterministic fallback in that case. |
| `pr_body` | str \| null | LLM-written PR body (markdown) from the `pr_writer` worker. Null on the same conditions as `pr_title`. |
| `pr_template_used` | str \| null | repo-relative path of the PR template the worker filled out (e.g. `.github/pull_request_template.md`). Null when the worker produced its no-template default structure. |
| `chain_id` | str \| null | UUID of the chain this run is part of. Written twice: (1) early-write by the child process immediately after `provision_machine` succeeds (so chain-scoped verbs can discover the run while the orchestrator is still running); (2) re-written by the parent's post-wait tagging loop after `fetch_branch` overwrites run.json with the orchestrator's copy. Null for runs not spawned as part of a chain. Used by chain-scoped verbs (`--list --chains`, `--status`, `--kill`, `--attach`, `--resume`) to discover chain runs. |
| `wave_idx` | int \| null | Zero-based wave index within the chain (set alongside `chain_id`). Used by the chain wave-sequencer to group runs by wave for synth-merge between waves. Null when `chain_id` is null. |
| `health` | dict \| null | Advisory run-health signals (DESIGN §9). Written by two seams and merged, never mutually exclusive: (1) `capture_conformance_baseline` writes `base_suite` `{status: "green"\|"red", red_axes: list[str]}` at the start of `phase_execute` — the build/lint/test exit-code verdict on the unmodified base tree; (2) `_record_run_health` writes `slowest_worker_sid` (str \| null), `slowest_worker_min` (float — the largest summed per-worker `duration_ms`, in minutes), and `truncated_worker_count` (int — worker logs that ended a result with `terminal_reason="max_turns"`) at finalize, preserving any existing `base_suite`. Purely informational — never gates; `_validate_run_json` imposes no invariant on it. Null when neither seam ran (e.g. a no-work run, or `--skip-base-baseline` on a run that also never reached finalize). |

`_validate_run_json(data)` enforces these invariants on read:
- `pushed_at` and `push_error` are mutually exclusive (at most one is non-null).
- `pr_url` and `pr_error` are mutually exclusive.
- If `pr_url` is set, `pushed_at` must be set (cannot have a PR without a push).
- `paused_at`, `pushed_at`, and `killed_at` are mutually exclusive (a run cannot be in more than one terminal-or-paused state). If `paused_at` is set, `fly_machine_id` must also be set (you cannot pause a run without knowing where to resume it). If `killed_at` is set, `fly_machine_id` must also be set (you cannot have destroyed a machine you don't have a pointer to).
- `sync_failed_at` is mutex-checked against `pushed_at` (a successfully pushed run can't be sync-failed) and against `killed_at` (a destroyed machine can't be sync-failed). When `sync_failed_at` is set, `fly_machine_id` must also be set — the running machine needs a pointer for the user to recover via `--finalize`/`--kill`.
- If `volume_id` is set, `fly_machine_id` must also be set — a Fly volume without a machine to attach it to is a corrupt sidecar (provision.sh always writes the two together).
- `killed_at` runs are not resumable; `--resume` against a killed run errors with "run was killed at <ts>; start a new run instead."

A corrupt sidecar is flagged but does not block the rest of the system; `leerie --list` will render that run with `status=corrupt-sidecar` and the user can inspect or delete the file.

`leerie --list` derives a single status per run via `_derive_run_status(run_json, state_json)`. The taxonomy is checked in priority order — earlier rows fire first:

| Status | When it fires | Typical next step |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| `corrupt-sidecar` | `run.json` violates one of the four invariants above | inspect the file under `<state-root>/runs/<id>/run.json` |
| `push-failed` | `push_error` is set | re-run `git push -u origin leerie/<id>` after fixing the access issue |
| `pr-failed` | `pr_error` is set (and push succeeded) | re-run `gh pr create` manually using the command logged at finalize |
| `done-pushed-pr` | `pr_url` is set | the happy path: PR open, work merged locally |
| `done-pushed-no-pr` | `pushed_at` set but `pr_url` not | rare: push succeeded, PR wasn't attempted (e.g., gh removed between push and PR) |
| `sync-failed` | `sync_failed_at` set (and no `killed_at`) | the orchestrator finished but `fetch_branch` failed; the Fly machine is still running with un-synced work. Run `leerie --finalize <id>` to retry sync + push, or `leerie --resume <id>` to inspect manually (default tails the log; `--shell` opens a bash session); only `leerie --kill <id>` once work is safely on host. (DESIGN §6 *Remote pause-on-failure* — sync-before-destroy contract.) |
| `done` | `finished_at` set, no `pushed_at` | the user passed `--no-push`, or the orchestrator exited via `die()` after the run directory was created (e.g. unresolved subtasks). In the latter case, `--resume` re-enters `phase_execute` normally — `finished_at` is overwritten on success. |
| `paused` | `paused_at` is set | inspect/attach to the Fly Machine, then `leerie --resume <id> --runtime fly` (DESIGN §6 *Remote pause-on-failure*) |
| `killed` | `killed_at` is set | terminal state — the machine was destroyed by `leerie --kill`. Not resumable; start a new run instead. |
| `in-progress` | none of the above | the run is still active (or died very early); resume with `--resume <id>` |

`RUN_STATUSES` in `leerie.py` declares the ten values; a test coupling check asserts the tuple matches every value `_derive_run_status` can return.

`leerie --list --status <state>` filters the table to runs whose derived status matches. `<state>` accepts any value in `RUN_STATUSES`; invalid values produce an argparse error listing the allowed set. `--list` short-circuits before any git/CLI preflight.

`state.json` fields. This table is canonical: every field the orchestrator
writes to `st.data` must appear here, and every field listed here must be
written somewhere in `orchestrator/leerie.py`. The coupling test in
`tests/test_state_fields.py` enforces parity in both directions against the
`STATE_FIELDS` tuple in `leerie.py`.

| Field | Shape | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `task` | str | the task description passed on the command line |
| `started_at` | ISO-8601 str | wall-clock time at run start |
| `finished_at` | ISO-8601 str | wall-clock time at successful finalize |
| `waves` | list[list[str]] | scheduled subtask ids per wave (from `schedule`) |
| `completed_waves` | int | index of the next wave to run (resume cursor) |
| `subtask_status` | dict[str, str] | per-subtask terminal status |
| `blocked` | dict[str, str] | per-subtask blocker reason when a wave aborts |
| `worker_count` | int | running total of `claude -p` invocations against `max_total_workers` |
| `current_phase` | str | the orchestrator's active phase string (e.g. `"phase 2: planning"`, `"phase 4-5: implementing"`); written at each phase entry and read by `_memory_sampler` so each `memory.ndjson` sample can be correlated with the phase that produced it. Empty string before phase 1 fires |
| `telemetry` | dict | calls, cost_usd, input_tokens, output_tokens — printed at run end |
| `categories` | list[str] | classifier output, post-whitelist filtering |
| `classifier_questions` | list[dict] | intent questions the classifier surfaced |
| `answers` | dict[str, str] | user answers to classifier questions (and source-of-truth) |
| `needs_source_of_truth` | bool | whether classifier asked for source-of-truth disambiguation |
| `source_of_truth_pref` | str | resolved preference (`codebase` / `research` / `both`) |
| `clarify` | bool | whether asking the user is allowed for this run (resolved from `--clarify` / `LEERIE_CLARIFY` / `leerie.toml` / default `False`) |
| `dangerously_skip_permissions` | bool | whether every `claude -p` worker — including the judgment workers running in the real repo cwd — is invoked with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Resolved from `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `LEERIE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` / `leerie.toml` / default `False`. When `True`, waives the DESIGN §12 mechanical read-only enforcement on the classifier / planner / reconciler / plan_overlap_judge / provision workers; trust shifts onto their prompts. Re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can flip it without editing state |
| `skip_overlap_judge` | bool | whether the phase 2¾ `plan_overlap_judge` worker is suppressed even on multi-planner runs (DESIGN §5 *Cross-domain surface overlap*). Resolved from `--skip-overlap-judge` / `LEERIE_SKIP_OVERLAP_JUDGE` / `leerie.toml` / default `False`. The cheap-skip on single-planner / <2-subtask runs is automatic and not gated by this field — this flag only affects runs where the worker would otherwise fire. Re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can flip it without editing state |
| `skip_budget_check` | bool | whether `check_budget_feasibility()` (DESIGN §13 *Budget feasibility — fail fast at the cheapest moment*) is suppressed. Resolved from `--skip-budget-check` / `LEERIE_SKIP_BUDGET_CHECK` / `leerie.toml` / default `False`. The runtime backstop in `State.bump_workers()` is independent of this field — it always fires when the counter actually exceeds `max_total_workers`; this flag only suppresses the *early* die() that catches mathematically-unwinnable runs at the plan/execute boundary. Re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can flip it without editing state. On `--resume` the preflight is moot regardless — the resume path enters past `schedule()` so the check has nothing to gate |
| `skip_satisfied_check` | bool | whether `filter_satisfied_subtasks()` (DESIGN §8 *Already-satisfied subtask elimination*) is suppressed. Resolved from `--skip-satisfied-check` / `LEERIE_SKIP_SATISFIED_CHECK` / `leerie.toml` / default `False`. When set, no `satisfied_probe` worker spawns and every subtask proceeds to `schedule()`; the mechanical `check_branch_has_commits` backstop then still catches an already-satisfied subtask post-execution (as a retryable no-op). Re-resolved fresh on every run; on `--resume` the phase-3 filter is past, so the flag only affects fresh runs. |
| `strict_conformer` | bool | whether the conformer phase is blocking instead of advisory (DESIGN §9 *Post-work conformance*, "Opt-in strict mode" paragraph). Resolved from `--strict-conformer` / `LEERIE_STRICT_CONFORMER` / `leerie.toml` / default `False`. When True, conformer residuals (failed build/lint/test axes or unresolved rule violations) cause the subtask to return `blocked` instead of `complete`; the final-tree pass also blocks the run if residuals remain. The user fixes the residuals and runs `--resume`. Re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can flip it without editing state |
| `skip_base_baseline` | bool | whether the base-tree health baseline (DESIGN §9 *Base-tree health baseline*) is suppressed. Resolved from `--skip-base-baseline` / `LEERIE_SKIP_BASE_BASELINE` / `leerie.toml` / default `False`. When True, `capture_conformance_baseline` does not run at the start of `phase_execute`, so no `conformance._baseline` is recorded and the conformer receives no `BASELINE:` context (falling back to self-judging "pre-existing" failures). Skips the once-per-run install-into-staging + full-suite-run cost. Re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can flip it without editing state |
| `skip_repo_map` | bool | whether the P6 repo-map structural context (DESIGN §5½ (P6) *Codebase structural map*) is suppressed. Resolved from `--skip-repo-map` / `LEERIE_SKIP_REPO_MAP` / `skip_repo_map` in `leerie.toml` / default `False`. When True, `build_repo_map()` is not called and the planner/splitter receive no ranked-subgraph injection, degrading gracefully to the prior grep/glob-only planning path. Use on repos where tree-sitter cannot parse the primary language, or to opt out of structural context. Re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can flip it without editing state |
| `cgroup_containment` | dict | recorded by the fail-closed gate (`enforce_and_record_cgroup_containment`, in `_run_phases` just before the first worker spawns) (DESIGN §6 *Memory containment*): `{enforced: bool, hierarchy: "v2"\|"v1"\|null}`. `enforced` is the result of the root-broker probe round-trip (create+enroll+destroy of a throwaway cgroup); `hierarchy` is the cgroup version the broker detected. When `enforced` is `False` the run only proceeds if `--dangerously-allow-uncapped` was set (else the gate `die()`s). Persisted so the containment state is visible in `state.json` — the crash that motivated the broker left no artifact of the silent containment failure |
| `verbosity` | str | resolved verbosity level (`quiet` / `normal` / `stream` / `debug`); re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can dial up or down without editing state |
| `inspect_dirs` | list[str] | extra absolute paths granted to inspect-bucket workers (classifier, planner, reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, provision) via `--add-dir`. Resolved from `--inspect-dir` / `LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS` / `inspect_dirs` in `leerie.toml`; re-resolved fresh on every run, including `--resume`, so the user can add or remove paths without editing state. Empty list when nothing is configured |
| `integrator_warnings` | dict[str, str] | non-fatal commit warnings from `integrate_wave` (non-fatal signal log) |
| `scope_warnings` | dict[str, dict] | oversized-diff warnings from `check_diff_scope` (non-fatal signal log) |
| `conformance` | dict[str, dict] | per-subtask conformer output and `conformance_warnings` (non-fatal signal log). Keys are subtask ids *or* the literal `_final` sentinel; values are `{result, warnings}` where `result` is the last conformer payload (or null on crash) and `warnings` is the list of advisory strings produced across all conformance rounds. The `_final` entry holds the post-integration whole-tree conformer pass's output (DESIGN §6 *Worktree and integration model*, final-tree pass paragraph); the leading-underscore convention guarantees no collision with subtask ids, which always start with a `<verb>-` prefix per `_ID_PREFIXES`. The per-subtask entries are populated only on subtasks whose implementer reached `status: "complete"`; the `_final` entry is populated whenever `run_final_conformance` ran (skipped only when the staging worktree or `working_branch` is absent, or on `--resume` after the pass already recorded a result). See DESIGN §9 *Post-work conformance* |
| `provision` | dict | output of `phase_provision` (DESIGN §6½). Keys: `source` (`table` / `llm` / `skipped-docs-only`), `recipe` (list of validated install entries, persisted for worker prompt injection — NOT executed by the orchestrator), `sh_hook_ran` (bool, set by `run_setup_hook`), `mise_versions` (raw blob from `mise ls --current --json`), `override_file` (absolute path to a synthesized mise override when `phase_provision` had to bridge a polyglot Go repo; `None` otherwise — re-exported as `MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES` on `--resume`). Read by `_format_provision_recipe_section()` so implementer/conformer prompts can inject the recipe as a `PROVISION_RECIPE:` advisory block. |
| `external_preconditions` | list[dict] | planner-declared `extent: external` `requires` entries collected during `phase_reconcile` (DESIGN §5 `requires.extent`). Each item is `{tag, reasons: [{sid, reason}, …], originating_subtasks: [sid, …]}`, deduped by tag. Read by `write_plan()` and persisted as the `preconditions` section of `plan.json`. Empty list when no planner declared any external requirement (the common case). |
| `dropped_subtasks` | dict[str, dict] | subtasks soft-dropped pre-schedule. Two producers, distinguished by shape: `filter_offtree_subtasks()` drops subtasks whose `files_likely_touched` resolved outside the run's repo root (value `{reasons: [str], files: [str]}`); `filter_satisfied_subtasks()` (DESIGN §8 *Already-satisfied subtask elimination*) drops subtasks the `satisfied_probe` judged already met on the base tree (value `{reason: "already_satisfied", evidence: str, checked: [str]}`). Absent when no drop fired. Audit trail only — the run proceeds with the surviving subtasks; no orchestrator code reads back from this field. |
| `conditional_drops` | dict[str, dict] | planner-emitted consumer subtasks dropped by the reconciler's `conditional_drops` resolution op (DESIGN §5) — i.e. the planner authored the subtask as "no-op if X" and X turned out to be unresolvable. Each value is `{reason: str, from_unresolved_tag: str}` where `reason` quotes the consumer's conditional intent + names why the precondition is false (the reconciler emits this) and `from_unresolved_tag` records which unresolved tag's resolution motivated the drop (looked up from the unresolved set at apply time). Absent when no conditional_drop fired. Distinct audit field from `dropped_subtasks` (off-tree soft drops, phase 3) so the two causes stay separately auditable. |
| `speculative_collapse_drops` | list[str] | subtask sids mechanically pruned by dead-subtask elimination (DESIGN §5) — fully-speculative subtasks whose every `in_plan` requires was unresolvable because the provider domain returned 0 subtasks. Recorded before `_check_unresolvable` runs so the audit trail survives even when `die()` fires for remaining unresolvable entries. Absent when no dead-subtask elimination fired. Distinct from `conditional_drops` (LLM-judged, based on conditional prose in intent) and `dropped_subtasks` (off-tree soft drops, phase 3). |
| `plan_overlap_judge` | dict | full output of the phase 2¾ `plan_overlap_judge` worker (DESIGN §5 *Cross-domain surface overlap*) — `{collisions: [{a_sid, b_sid, artifact, resolution, reason, merge_feasibility?}, …]}`. Persisted before the apply step (so if a `die()` fires on `unresolvable` or the merge-feasibility backstop the audit record survives). Absent when `phase_overlap_judge` cheap-skipped (single-planner / <2-subtask runs / `--skip-overlap-judge`) or when the judge returned `{collisions: []}`. |
| `plan_overlap_applied` | list[dict] | post-apply mutation summary for the phase 2¾ judge. Each entry is either `{action: merge|drop_a|drop_b, artifact: str, surviving_sid: str, dropped_sid: str, reason: str}` recording a mutation against the plan, or `{action: skipped_redundant, artifact: str, collapsed_to: str, original_a_sid: str, original_b_sid: str, merge_feasibility: str, reason: str}` recording a redundant pair whose endpoints had already collapsed to the same survivor via an earlier resolution (the closing edge of a connected cluster — kept in the audit trail so resume-time inspection sees every collision the judge emitted). The anchor-survivor rule may make the `surviving_sid` differ from `_apply_overlap_merge`'s default lex-smaller pick when the merge participates in a cluster — see "Phase 2¾ checks" above. Useful for resume-time replay debugging — `state.data["plan_overlap_judge"]` records what the judge said, this records what the orchestrator did. Empty list when the judge returned no collisions; absent when the phase cheap-skipped. |
| `no_work_required` | bool | set to `True` by `_finish_no_work_run` when every planner returns `status: "ready"` with `subtasks: []` (DESIGN §8 *The cleared-but-empty terminal state*). When `True`, the orchestrator wrote `finished_at`, skipped phases 3–6, and exited 0 — the task was already satisfied on HEAD, no run branch was materialized, no PR will be opened. `leerie --list` renders the run as `done` (no push, no PR, distinct from `done-pushed-no-pr` and `done-pushed-pr`). Absent on every normal run. |
| `no_work_reasons` | dict[str, str] | per-domain `confidence.basis` quoted from each planner's empty-but-ready output, recorded alongside `no_work_required` for audit. Keys are domain names (e.g. `"bug-fixing"`, `"testing"`); values are the `basis` string the planner emitted explaining why no work was needed. Absent on every normal run. |
| `working_branch` | str | the user's branch at the moment `phase_classify` runs (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`). Captured once and mirrored to three locations: `run.json.working_branch`, `<state-root>/runs/<id>/working-branch` (written later by `setup-run.sh`), and `state.json` via this field. Read by `_compose_pr_via_llm` as the `git diff` base for the PR-writer payload and by `run_final_conformance` as the `DIFF_BASE` for the post-integration whole-tree pass. Empty string when the host `git` invocation failed (interactive fallback path); the readers tolerate this. |
| `leerie_version` | str | the leerie version string from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at the time the run started (or resumed). Persisted so the PR footer and Run metadata block can show the exact version that produced the run, which aids debugging when a run was produced by an older release. |
| `dep_capture_done` | bool | set to `True` in `state.json` by `capture_repo_deps` after a successful write. Combined with the sibling sentinel file `<run_dir>/dep_capture.done`, this makes the next-run backstop idempotent: the backstop skips runs whose sentinel file is present, and the cancel-arm capture skips already-captured runs. Absent on runs where capture was skipped or has not yet run. |

`pending-questions.json` (written by `gather_answers` on non-TTY exit, read by
the plugin skill in `commands/leerie.md`):

| Field | Shape | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `questions` | array of `{id, question, why_underivable?}` | the classifier-surfaced intent questions not already in `--answers` |

`answers.json` (written by the plugin skill, passed back via
`--answers <state-root>/answers.json`):

| Field | Shape | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `<question id>` | string | one entry per question id from `pending-questions.json.questions[].id` |
| `source_of_truth` | `"codebase"` / `"research"` / `"both"` | optional; overrides the resolved preference for this run |

The checkpoint schema — seven required sections, enforced by
`validate_checkpoint()`: *Frozen success criteria*, *Current status*, *Files
touched*, *Decisions made*, *Evidence gate status*, *Next action*, *Open
unknowns*. `validate_checkpoint()` enforces three layers: (a) every section
header must be present; (b) every section must carry non-whitespace content; (c)
the five "must carry handoff context" sections reject single-token
placeholder content (`none`/`n/a`/`na`/`tbd`/`nothing`/`unknown`/`todo`/`pending`/`—`/`--`/`-`/`?`) — the two
"nothing-to-report-is-OK" sections (*Decisions made*, *Open unknowns*)
accept these. Trailing punctuation (`.`/`!`/`?`/`…`) is stripped before
the comparison and repeated `?` is collapsed, so `None.`, `TBD!`, and
`???` are caught alongside the bare tokens. When a `worktree_root` is passed, `validate_checkpoint()`
also runs a freshness check: every path listed under *Files touched* must
either still exist in the worktree or carry a `[deleted]` annotation,
catching stale checkpoints whose paths were removed by partial work after
the snapshot was written.

In the same vein, `claude_p()` logs a context-decay warning when a worker
returns at ≥80% of its `--max-turns` budget (`num_turns` from the CLI
envelope). This is a proxy, not a hard guard: the schema only validates
the *shape* of the worker's final output, not whether the reasoning
chain that produced it ran against a healthy context. A 9.x confidence
score from a near-cap worker should be read with appropriate scepticism.
The warning sits alongside the existing `terminal_reason` warning at the
`claude_p` return path.

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §10 (handoff, coordination-artifact location), §9 (criteria
locking).

## 9. Structured-output schemas

`claude_p()` validates each worker's payload against a schema keyed by worker
type. Required fields, current shape:

- **classifier** — required: `categories` (array). Optional: `questions`
  (array of `{id, question, why_underivable?}` — only `id` and `question`
  are required on each question), `source_of_truth_question` (bool). The
  classifier only flags whether the source-of-truth question is relevant;
  the orchestrator's preference resolution (see §2) supplies the value
  (default `both`).
- **planner** — required: `domain`, `subtasks`, `status`, `confidence`.
  `status` is the enum `ready` / `blocked` (DESIGN §8 planner gate): when
  the planner's evidence gate could not clear within `confidence_rounds`,
  it emits `blocked` with an empty subtasks list and the gap analysis in
  `confidence.gap_to_close`. A `ready` plan may also legitimately carry
  an empty `subtasks` list (the cleared-but-empty terminal state — "I
  understand the task, I investigated this domain, the work is already
  satisfied on HEAD"); see DESIGN §8 and the phase 3 `detect_no_work`
  short-circuit above. `confidence` is the worker-internal self-gate
  object: required keys `task_understanding` (number 1–10),
  `decomposition_quality` (number 1–10), `basis` (string), `falsifiers_tested`
  (array of strings — what would-disprove probes were run and what they
  showed), `contradictions_reconciled` (array of strings — any contradictions
  with the worker's own prior statements, named with the kept version's
  evidence), `gap_to_close` (object with optional `task_understanding` and
  `decomposition_quality` strings — populated when either score is below
  9.0). Each subtask is `{id, title,
  success_criteria_seed (all required), intent, scope_note,
  files_likely_touched, depends_on, requires, provides, size,
  investigation_notes}`. **`requires` is an array of objects, not bare
  strings: `{tag (required string), extent (required enum: "in_plan" |
  "external"), reason (string, required and non-empty when extent ==
  "external")}`. `extent: in_plan` is satisfied by another subtask's
  `provides` (a graph edge); `extent: external` is a planner-declared
  out-of-graph prerequisite (other repo, ops runbook, manual step) that
  bypasses the reconciler and surfaces in `plan.json` as a `preconditions`
  entry — see DESIGN §5 `requires.extent`.** `provides` remains an array of
  bare strings. `size` is `small` or `medium` — `large` is
  rejected by `validate_plan`. The schema's required-ness of `confidence`
  and `status` is the structural part of DESIGN §8's discipline: a worker
  that skipped self-gating fails its own JSON schema before the orchestrator
  reads the payload.
- **implementer** — required: `subtask_id`, `status` (`complete` /
  `incomplete-handoff` / `blocked` / `failed` / `needs-clarification`).
  Optional: `branch`, `criteria_results` (array of
  `{criterion, met, evidence}`), `confidence` (worker-internal self-gate,
  not consumed by the orchestrator: required keys when present are
  `root_cause` and `solution` (numbers 1–10), `basis` (string),
  `falsifiers_tested` (array of strings), `contradictions_reconciled`
  (array of strings), and `gap_to_close` (object with optional
  `root_cause` and `solution` strings — populated when either score is
  below 9.0); see DESIGN §8 for the disciplines these fields make
  mechanically required), `checkpoint_path`, `blocker`, `summary`,
  `clarification_question` (DESIGN §11 mid-execution exception channel:
  `{id, question, why_underivable}` — all three required when the
  object is present; emitted only with `status: "needs-clarification"`,
  required to carry `checkpoint_path` as well so the work-in-progress
  survives the question to the user; orchestrator surfaces the question
  through the same interactive/non-interactive paths used by the
  Phase-1 classifier), `artifacts` (DESIGN §5 *Artifact passing between
  subtasks*: array of `{name (required string), kind (required enum
  "markdown" | "json" | "text"), content (required string),
  summary (optional string)}` — structured deliverables for downstream
  subtasks whose predecessor graph names this subtask; absent or empty
  for code-implementation subtasks). The criteria file is informational
  per DESIGN §9; `criteria_results` is recorded for telemetry but does
  not gate the subtask. The retired `criteria_revision_proposal` field
  is no longer in the schema.
- **integrator** — required: `incoming_subtask`, `status` (`resolved` /
  `design-conflict` / `failed`). Optional: `resolution_summary`,
  `diagnosis` (read as a fallback for `resolution_summary` when
  diagnosing a non-`resolved` outcome).
- **conformer** — required: `subtask_id`, `rules_files_read` (array of
  strings — paths the conformer was handed by `discover_rules_files`; empty
  list when none were found), `rule_violations_fixed` (array of
  `{rule, fix, evidence}` — `rule` is the verbatim line from a rules file
  that was being honored, `fix` describes the change made, `evidence` cites
  the file/lines touched), `rule_violations_residual` (array of
  `{rule, why_not_fixed}` — violations the conformer spotted but did not
  resolve, with the reason), `docs_updates` (array of `{path, reason}` —
  documentation files updated to reflect the diff), `tests_updates` (array
  of `{path, reason}` — tests added or amended to cover the diff), `build`,
  `lint`, `tests` (each an object `{ran (bool), passed (bool), command
  (string), summary (string)}` — `ran: false` when the tool is not
  applicable to the repo; `passed` is irrelevant when `ran: false`),
  `summary` (string — one-line description of what the conformance pass
  did), `confidence` (worker-internal self-gate, not consumed by the
  orchestrator: required keys `conformance` (number 1–10), `basis`
  (string), `falsifiers_tested` (array of strings), `contradictions_reconciled`
  (array of strings), `gap_to_close` (object — populated when conformance
  is below 9.0); see DESIGN §8 for the disciplines these fields make
  mechanically required). The schema enforces the structural part of
  DESIGN §9 *Post-work conformance*: a conformer that skipped its own
  honesty discipline (e.g. wrote `passed: true` without a `command`, or
  omitted the self-gate block) fails the schema before the orchestrator
  reads it. The cross-field invariants — residuals require a non-empty
  `rules_files_read`, every `rule_violations_fixed` item cites a non-empty
  `rule`, every `docs_updates` / `tests_updates` `path` exists in the
  worktree — are enforced by `validate_conformance_result()`.
- **judge** — required: `passed` (bool — aggregate verdict, true only when all
  three dimensions are true), `dimensions` (object with required boolean fields
  `schema_ok`, `factual_ok`, `hallucination_ok`), `rationale` (str — 1–3
  sentence explanation for the verdict), `suggested_fixes` (array of strings —
  empty when `passed: true`). One verdict object per `judge_capture()` call.
  Used by `phase_judge()` / `judge_capture()` — not by the orchestrator's main
  workflow workers. `prompts/judge.md` carries the rubric.
- **patch_generator** — required: `anchor` (str — the exact substring of the
  current system prompt that the patch should replace; the heal loop validates
  this against the actual prompt text before applying), `replacement` (str —
  the new text to substitute for `anchor`). Optional: `strategy` (str — a
  one-line description of what the patch changes and why), `pivot_reason`
  (str \| null — why this iteration pivots from the prior strategy, or null if
  this is the first iteration or no pivot). The `patch_generator` schema is used
  by the self-heal skill's patch-generation worker; like `judge`, it is
  post-run and not used by the orchestrator's main `claude_p()`.

Schemas are embedded as Python dicts in `leerie.py` and serialized inline.

## 10. Telemetry — NDJSON envelope and call_type mapping

Maps to `DESIGN.md`: §14.

### NDJSON envelope schema

Every `claude_p()` invocation appends one JSON object (one line) to
`<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/calls.ndjson` immediately after the call returns.
The file is opened for append at run start and is never truncated — it is
always a valid NDJSON file through the last complete line even under a hard
kill. It is never read by the orchestrator at runtime; reading is a
post-run operation performed by the judge and heal skills.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `call_id` | str (UUID v4) | unique identifier for this invocation; referenced by judge verdicts |
| `run_id` | str | the run identifier — matches the directory name under `<state-root>/runs/` |
| `call_type` | str | one of the schema keys `claude_p()` accepts: the eleven `WORKER_TYPES` (`classifier`, `planner`, `reconciler`, `plan_overlap_judge`, `satisfied_probe`, `provision`, `implementer`, `integrator`, `conformer`, `fit_judge`, `splitter`) plus the four post-run / finalize workers (`pr_writer`, `judge`, `patch_generator`, `dep_capture`) |
| `model` | str | the model alias passed to `--model` for this invocation (e.g. `opus`, `sonnet`) |
| `system_prompt` | str | the full system prompt injected via `--append-system-prompt` |
| `user_content` | str | the user-turn content passed to the worker |
| `response_content` | str | the worker's raw text response (before schema parsing) |
| `parsed_ok` | bool | whether `structured_output` was present and schema-valid |
| `input_tokens` | int | `usage.input_tokens` from the CLI envelope |
| `output_tokens` | int | `usage.output_tokens` from the CLI envelope |
| `latency_ms` | int | wall-clock milliseconds from subprocess start to return |
| `success` | bool | whether the call produced a schema-valid result (false on WorkerError or schema retry exhaustion) |
| `failure_kind` | str \| null | why a call failed, or `null` on success. Derived at the capture site by `_classify_failure_kind` from the returned envelope: `api_error` (with `:auth`/`:quota`/`:overload` suffix for `api_error_status` 401/429/529), `incomplete` (non-`completed` `terminal_reason`, e.g. `--max-turns`), or `schema_parse_failed` (returned but output failed schema validation — the dominant case). **Known gap:** rate-limit / out-of-credits / hard-crash failures raise `RateLimitedExit`/`WorkerError` past the capture block, so no record is written for them and `failure_kind` cannot cover them. |
| `cgroup_applied` | bool | whether per-worker cgroup memory/PID containment was active for this spawn (`_CGROUP_PROBE_RESULT`); a run with this consistently `false` means the writable `/sys/fs/cgroup` mount did not propagate |
| `ts` | str (ISO-8601) | UTC timestamp at the moment the line is written |

The judge skill consumes `system_prompt`, `user_content`, `response_content`,
and `parsed_ok` to evaluate quality. The heal loop uses `system_prompt` and
`user_content` to replay a call against a patched prompt. The `call_type`
field partitions calls for per-type analysis; judge and heal always operate
on one `call_type` at a time.

### Capture file path

```
<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/calls.ndjson
```

One file per run. Written by the orchestrator; the judge and heal skills
read it as a post-run harvest.

### Reporting — the `--report` verb

`leerie --report [RUN_ID]` is a read-only telemetry report for a single run;
like `--list` it exits without running orchestrate. Run selection reuses
`resolve_run_id` (exact-match a passed id, else auto-pick the sole run, else
die with the available list). It prints:

- a header (status, duration, and the `state.json` `telemetry` aggregate —
  calls, `$cost`, in/out tokens);
- a per-`call_type` breakdown from `calls.ndjson` — count, input/output
  tokens, average latency, failure count — sorted by call count descending,
  built by `_aggregate_calls`;
- a `failures by kind` rollup of `failure_kind` values, when any failed; and
- a memory-peak line (peak `rss_kb`, max `open_fds`/`thread_count`) from
  `memory.ndjson`, via `_memory_peak`.

All inputs already exist on disk; `--report` adds no new telemetry.

### call_type → prompt-resolution table

Each `call_type` maps to exactly one system-prompt source. The table below
is the complete, canonical mapping — no call_type is ever spawned without
a system prompt, and no system prompt is shared between call types.

| call_type        | Prompt source | Notes |
|------------------|---------------|-------|
| `classifier`     | `prompts/classifier.md` | read from disk by the orchestrator |
| `planner`        | `prompts/planner.md` | read from disk |
| `reconciler`     | `prompts/reconciler.md` | read from disk |
| `satisfied_probe`| `prompts/satisfied_probe.md` | per-subtask base-tree already-satisfied probe, phase 3 (DESIGN §8 *Already-satisfied subtask elimination*) |
| `provision`      | `prompts/provision.md` | LLM fallback when the lockfile table misses (DESIGN §6½) |
| `implementer`    | `prompts/implementer.md` | read from disk |
| `integrator`     | `prompts/integrator.md` | read from disk |
| `conformer`      | `prompts/conformer.md` | read from disk |
| `pr_writer`      | `prompts/pr_writer.md` | invoked by `phase_finalize` when `push_will_happen` is true (DESIGN §6 *Finalization*) |
| `judge`          | `prompts/judge.md` | post-run skill; not used by the main orchestrate loop |
| `patch_generator`| `prompts/patch_generator.md` | post-run heal-loop worker |

Every `call_type` resolves to a file under `prompts/`. The heal loop's
patch-generator worker calls
`resolve_prompt(call_type: str) -> tuple[str, str, str]` to load a
worker's system prompt: given any member of `WORKER_TYPES` (the
self-heal target set is the eleven main-loop workers, not the post-run
workers), it returns `(source_kind, content, location_hint)` where
`source_kind` is `"file"`, `content` is the prompt body, and
`location_hint` is the relative path `"prompts/<call_type>.md"`.
Raises `ValueError` for an unknown `call_type`. (Earlier iterations of leerie also exposed a `validator`
call type whose prompt lived as a `VALIDATOR_SYSTEM` constant inside
`leerie.py`; that worker was retired when the criteria file became
informational, and `resolve_prompt` no longer carries a
file-or-constant branch.)

### replay_capture — primitive for judge and heal-loop replays

```python
async def replay_capture(
    record: dict,
    *,
    override_system_prompt: str | None = None,
    cwd: str | None = None,
) -> tuple[dict, dict]:
```

Given one NDJSON record from `calls.ndjson`, reconstructs the `claude_p()`
invocation with the captured `system_prompt`, `user_content`, `call_type`
(used as `schema_key`), and `model`, and returns `(envelope, structured_output)`
from the new invocation.

`override_system_prompt` lets the heal loop replay with a patched prompt in
place of the originally captured one.

Replays use a throw-away in-memory `_ReplayState` and `_suppress_capture=True`
so they **never write to any `calls.ndjson`**. The capture stream is the ground
truth; replay results are ephemeral scoring artifacts.

Both judge (n=1 replay, then score) and heal (n=N replays, baseline vs patched)
build on this primitive.

## 11. Verification status of the code

Mirrors `DESIGN.md` §15, at the code level.

**Tested.** A pytest suite under `tests/` exercises the deterministic
enforcement functions:

| Test file | Function under test |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `test_resolve_leerie_root.py` | `resolve_leerie_root()` — `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` set → custom path; unset/empty/whitespace → `<repo_root>/.leerie`; always absolute |
| `test_resolve_source_of_truth.py` | `resolve_source_of_truth()` |
| `test_resolve_runtime.py` | `resolve_runtime()` — CLI > env > TOML > default `local` precedence, both valid values, invalid-value die() paths, empty/whitespace env handling |
| `test_resolve_models.py` | `resolve_models()` — per-worker precedence (CLI > env > TOML), defaults, validation, empty/whitespace handling |
| `test_resolve_dep_capture_model.py` | `resolve_models()` / `resolve_efforts()` for `dep_capture` — full per-worker and global override precedence chain; `MODEL_DEP_CAPTURE_ENV` constant; `dep_capture` absent from `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` (falls through to `MODEL_DEFAULT`); `dep_capture` in `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` at `"high"`; isolation (override doesn't bleed to other workers); structural wiring guards |
| `test_rank_repo_map.py` | `rank_repo_map()` P6 ranking contract: seed-adjacent nodes rank above unrelated nodes (direct seed file, 1-hop neighbor via callee→caller edge, seed symbol biases definer, all connected-chain files before any island file); token-budget enforcement (explicit budget, `DEFAULT_CAPS["repo_map_tokens"]` when `None`, `None` == cap value, empty map returns `""`); binary-search shrink (lower budget → shorter output and fewer files, increasing budgets → non-decreasing lengths, tight budgets respected). Fixture built directly (no `build_repo_map`); no LLM calls; deterministic. |
| `test_resolve_fit_judge_model.py` | `resolve_models()` / `resolve_efforts()` for `fit_judge` and `splitter` — both in `WORKER_TYPES`; both absent from `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` (opus via `MODEL_DEFAULT`); both in `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER` at `"high"`; per-worker CLI/env/TOML override chains; isolation (override doesn't bleed to other workers); structural wiring guards |
| `test_resolve_fit_judge_splitter_model.py` | `resolve_models()` / `resolve_efforts()` for `fit_judge` and `splitter` — full per-worker and global override precedence chain (CLI > env > TOML > default); default model `opus` (via `MODEL_DEFAULT` fallback, absent from `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`); default effort `high` (via `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`); both workers in `WORKER_TYPES`; isolation (per-worker override doesn't bleed to planner or implementer) |
| `test_fit_judge_schema.py` | `SCHEMAS["fit_judge"]` — required fields (`score`, `rationale`, `diffuse`, `confidence`); `score` has `minimum:0`/`maximum:1`; `confidence` uses `"fit"` axis; valid/invalid instances; JSON serializable; wiring (`fit_judge` in `WORKER_TYPES`, NOT in `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`, `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER["fit_judge"] == "high"`, prompt file exists) |
| `test_splitter_schema.py` | `SCHEMAS["splitter"]` — `children` required, `minItems:1`, child required fields (`id`, `title`, `success_criteria_seed`), optional child fields; valid/invalid instances; JSON serializable; wiring (`splitter` in `WORKER_TYPES`, NOT in `MODEL_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER`, `EFFORT_DEFAULT_PER_WORKER["splitter"] == "high"`, prompt file exists); no top-level `files` field (splitter never decides partition — `test_splitter_no_top_level_files_required`); child `requires` array uses `_REQUIRES_ITEM` shape with tag + extent enum (`test_splitter_child_requires_item_shape`) |
| `test_recursive_decompose.py` | `partition_files()` — empty, single chunk, exact multiple, partial last chunk, 100% coverage, 0 overlap, chunk_size=1, order preserved, chunk_size<1; `recursive_decompose()` — well-fit is leaf (score ≥ 0.70), oversized recurses (split then children judged), depth cap terminates, no-progress guard terminates + emits "no-progress guard" warning to stdout (asserted via capsys), migration path partitions files via `partition_files()` and invokes the splitter only in label-only mode to title each chunk (distinct titles; distinct deterministic fallback on splitter failure), both `claude_p` call sites pass the full required signature (`cwd`/`autonomous`/`caps` — C0 regression guard), a passed `repo_map` is injected into fit_judge/splitter prompts and omitted when `None` (G2), bump_workers called before every claude_p |
| `test_phase_plan_repo_map_ctx.py` | P6 Layer A wiring (`phase_plan` ctx injection, DESIGN §5½ (P6)): repo-map enabled path (ctx contains `repo_map` key, non-empty string, JSON-serializable, known symbol names present, seed_files seeded from `task_file_items`); skip_repo_map=True path (ctx omits `repo_map`, baseline keys `task`/`source_of_truth`/`clarification_answers`/`confidence_rounds` present, values match inputs); empty-repo degrade (`rank_repo_map` returns `""` → key omitted); exception-swallow degrade (`build_repo_map` raises → caught silently, ctx emitted without `repo_map`) |
| `test_phase_plan_recursion_wiring.py` | P1 Layer C wiring (`phase_plan` recursion expansion, DESIGN §5½ *Wire-in to phase_plan*): source-coupling guard (`phase_plan` source contains `recursive_decompose(` at depth=0, reassigns `plan["subtasks"] = leaves`, expansion loop precedes final logging); integration — one oversized subtask (stubbed `recursive_decompose` → two leaves) → `plan["subtasks"]` has 2 entries; two first-pass subtasks → `recursive_decompose` called once per subtask; well-fit leaf pass-through (stub returns input unchanged → single-element `plan["subtasks"]`); empty-subtasks plan not touched (`recursive_decompose` never called, subtasks stays `[]`) |
| `test__read_toml_key.py` | `_read_toml_key()` — the shared `leerie.toml` line parser used by both resolvers |
| `test_gather_answers_validation.py` | the source-of-truth validation gate in `gather_answers()` |
| `test_retryable_failure.py` | `_retryable_failure()`, **including a coupling test** that every producer's retryable-path return tags a `failure_kind` in `_RETRYABLE_FAILURE_KINDS` (`validate_result`, `check_branch_has_commits`, the inline dirty-worktree check in `settle_subtask`) |
| `test_state_fields.py` | `STATE_FIELDS` tuple parity, in both directions: against the §8 field table, and against every `st.data[...] = …` / `setdefault(...)` write in `leerie.py`. This is the mechanism §8's "this table is canonical" claim relies on |
| `test_blocked_clear_on_complete.py` | Fix 2 state semantics: `settle_subtask` pops `blocked[sid]` when terminal status is `"complete"` and leaves it untouched on `"failed"` / `"blocked"`; safe no-op when no `blocked` key present; only the completing sid is removed from a multi-sid dict; coupling test that `settle_subtask` source contains the exact `st.data.get("blocked", {}).pop(sid, None)` expression |
| `test_validate_plan.py` | `validate_plan()` (every rule in §5) |
| `test_validate_result.py` | `validate_result()` (every status-branch invariant) |
| `test_check_merge_committed.py` | `check_merge_committed()` (real-git fixtures) |
| `test_inspect_tools.py` | `INSPECT_TOOLS` composition and the inspect-callsite wirings (classifier, planner, reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, provision) — pins that the inspect bucket grants `Bash(<verb>:*)` patterns but never `Write`/`Edit` or bare `Bash`, the same DESIGN §12 enforcement applied to workers that don't get `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| `test_resolve_inspect_dirs.py` | `resolve_inspect_dirs()` precedence (CLI → env → TOML → `[]`), `~` expansion, dedup, and `STATE_FIELDS` membership |
| `test_resolve_prompt.py` | `resolve_prompt()` — every `WORKER_TYPES` member returns a `("file", content, "prompts/<call_type>.md")` triple; parity/coupling test; unknown call_type raises |
| `test_orchestrate_call_sites.py` | Source-text coupling guards for load-bearing call sites in `_run_phases` and `settle_subtask`: `absorb_supplied_answers` on the resume path (P5-1 regression guard), `phase_reconcile` between `phase_plan` and `schedule` (order-sensitive), `plans = await phase_reconcile(plans, ...)` rebind (guards silent discard), `status == "needs-clarification"` branch calling `surface_clarification`, that branch consuming `caps["subtask_continuations"]` (unified cap, not a separate clarification counter), and `resolve_blt(repo_root)` call sites in both `_run_conformance_phase` and `run_final_conformance` (guards against regression to direct `_infer_build_lint_test()` calls that would silently ignore `.leerie/config.toml` overrides) |
| `test_discover_rules_files.py`, `test_validate_conformance_result.py`, `test_run_conformance_phase.py`, `test_run_final_conformance.py`, `test_infer_build_lint_test.py` | the post-work conformance phase (DESIGN §9) and the post-integration whole-tree conformance pass (DESIGN §6 *Worktree and integration model*, final-tree pass paragraph): rule-file discovery against the fixed capped allowlist, schema cross-field invariants including path-traversal rejection, the orchestrator-level loop covering clean / malformed / crashed / rolled-back / cap-exhausted paths, the commit-prefix observability check, the dirty-state warning before rollback, the worker-budget-exhausted advisory path, the outer `settle_subtask` contract (never escalates to `failed`/`blocked` even on `FileNotFoundError`, unless `--strict-conformer` is on), and `_infer_build_lint_test` across the supported package-manager families (Node/JS, Python, Rust, Go, Java/Maven, Gradle, C#/.NET, PHP, Ruby/Rails including rubocop detection, `bin/rails test` inference, and the `_is_rails_repo` two-file guard against Sinatra/Grape false positives). `test_run_final_conformance.py` additionally covers the staging-worktree skip path, the working_branch-absent skip path, the resume-idempotence short-circuit, the `_final_conformance_payload` PR-writer surfacing helper, and a coupling test that the call site lives between `phase_execute` and `phase_finalize` in `_run_phases` |
| `test_resolve_blt.py` | `_load_blt_config()` and `resolve_blt()`: no config → full inference fallthrough; all-3-keys → declared values used; partial config → declared key wins others inferred; empty-string value treated as "not applicable" not a fallthrough; config overrides inference even when inference would return a value; `_load_blt_config` returns None when file absent and dict of only-present keys otherwise, including `setup_packages` |
| `test_resolve_repo_image_tag.py` | `resolve_repo_image_tag()` and `_leerie_repo_id()` — embedded-harness bash tests: no Dockerfile + no setup_packages → empty string; Dockerfile present → tag `leerie-repo/<repo-id>:<version>`; repo-id from HTTPS/SSH remote or basename fallback; uppercase sanitized; rebuild matrix (image absent, hash mismatch, base version changed, all-match no rebuild); coupling test that sentinel lines co-occur in harness and live launcher |
| `test_launcher_cache_mounts.py` | Coupling test for the Ruby bundle cache in `CACHE_MOUNTS`: asserts `-v ...:/home/leerie/.cache/leerie/bundle` volume mount and `-e BUNDLE_PATH=.../bundle` env entry appear inside the `CACHE_MOUNTS=(...)` array; companion assertion confirms `$HOME/.cache/leerie/bundle` is `mkdir -p`'d before the array. Reads launcher source text directly — no subprocess — so a future refactor that drops the bundle lines causes immediate test failure (guards the regression where every `bundle install` recompiles gems from scratch). |
| `test_launcher_per_repo_image.py` | Per-repo derived image bash-harness tests: `resolve_repo_image_tag()` with/without Dockerfile and with setup_packages only; `_leerie_repo_id()` from HTTPS/SSH remote and basename fallback; `build_repo_image` success/failure/error-message sentinel; rebuild-skip when image present and hash matches; rebuild fires on hash mismatch or image absence |
| `test_dockerfile_autogen.py` | Auto-generation of `.leerie/Dockerfile` from `setup_packages`: generated content contains ARG BASE_IMAGE, FROM \$BASE_IMAGE, USER root, apt-get install, declared packages in order; **the generated Dockerfile does NOT end with a trailing `USER leerie` — the last `USER` directive is `USER root` so PID-1 stays root (DESIGN §6)**; log message emitted during auto-gen; existing Dockerfile preserved verbatim and suppresses auto-gen; no setup_packages + no Dockerfile → REPO_IMAGE_TAG empty, no build fires; coupling tests that sentinel strings exist verbatim in launcher source and that the generator does NOT printf a trailing `.../lists/*\nUSER leerie` |
| `test_dockerfile_bake_from_capture.py` | Bake-from-persisted-installs path (distinct from `test_dockerfile_autogen.py`): launcher emits apt layer from `setup_packages` plus a `COPY`+`RUN` layer per `language_installs` entry with embedded `copy-input-shas` comment; `p.exists()` guard silently drops hallucinated `copy_input` paths from COPY while always emitting the RUN; all copy_inputs absent → RUN emitted, no COPY; multi-manager (pnpm+pip) → two COPY+RUN layers each with their own sha comment; pip install with only `requirements.txt` (no lockfile) → baked via persisted path, not lockfile fallback; identical regen → bit-identical Dockerfile (sha stable, no needless rebuild); changing `copy_input` file content → sha comment changes; committed `.leerie/Dockerfile` left untouched even when `language_installs` present; **node-ancillary augmentation on the persisted path — a pnpm entry whose `copy_inputs` omit `patches/` still emits `COPY patches/ ./patches/` (its own path-preserving line, never flattened into `./`) with the patch sha folded into the rebuild comment; a workspace child `packages/a/package.json` is COPYed to `./packages/a/package.json` (no basename clobber); a non-node (poetry) install ignores a `patches/` dir; the apt layer has no trailing `USER leerie`**; coupling tests that `persisted_installs`, `.exists()`, `copy-input-shas`, and `language_installs` sentinel strings exist in extracted launcher block |
| `test_base_dockerfile_chromium.py` | Base image `./Dockerfile` (not the per-repo autogen one): asserts `chromium` and `chromium-driver` are installed and the three container flags (`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-setuid-sandbox`, `--disable-dev-shm-usage`) are baked into `/etc/chromium.d/leerie-container-flags` after the chromium install (ordering guard) — see *Browser-based testing* above |
| `test_config_verb.py` | `leerie config` verb (Phase 3 bash-harness tests): `--init` creates `.leerie/config.toml` with auto-detected BLT values (uncommented) and a commented `setup_packages` example, prints the path, suggests `git add .leerie/`, and does NOT invoke `nerdctl run`; bare mode prints each axis with provenance (`[config]` vs `[inference]`) and shows `leerie.toml` keys when present; `--chat` invokes `claude --system-prompt-file prompts/config_chat.md --add-dir <USER_REPO>` (NOT `claude -p`) without `nerdctl run`; `--recapture` exits 1 with diagnostic when no runs directory or no finished run found, and dispatches to the python3 seam (`run_recapture_deps`) when a finished run exists; `--recapture --force` triggers wholesale replace; content assertions on `prompts/config_chat.md` (exists, mentions `build`/`lint`/`test`/`setup_packages` keys, `ARG BASE_IMAGE`, `config.toml`, `Dockerfile`; instructs ending at `USER root` and does NOT instruct a trailing `USER leerie`) and a parallel guard that `docs/USAGE.md`'s hand-authored `.leerie/Dockerfile` example likewise has no trailing `USER leerie`; coupling tests that verify the `config)` arm exists in the live launcher and exits before `nerdctl run`. Also covers the Dockerfile language-layer bake-from-persisted-installs logic (extracted Python heredoc invoked directly): persisted `language_installs` → COPY+RUN emitted per manager; hallucinated copy_inputs silently dropped while RUN always emitted; all copy_inputs missing → RUN without COPY; multi-manager → multiple COPY+RUN layers; no persisted installs → lockfile-detection fallback; empty `language_installs` list → lockfile fallback; no lockfile and no persisted installs → empty output; identical inputs → identical output (hash stability). |
| `test_config_recapture.py` | `leerie config --recapture` LLM-seam dispatch and multi-run consolidation: launcher `--recapture` arm dispatches to the python3 seam; exits 1 with diagnostic when no runs directory or no finished run found; `--force` flag passed to the seam; python3 failure exits 1; no `nerdctl` invoked; `--recapture` arm within extraction boundary; `run_recapture_deps` consolidates across ≥2 finished runs (all captured, not just newest); `--force` drops sentinel on each run (wholesale replace semantics); without `--force` already-captured runs are skipped (never-clobber union); Dockerfile survivor tests (committed and generated) |
| `test_replay_capture.py` | `replay_capture()` — args reconstructed from capture record, `override_system_prompt` plumbed through, no `calls.ndjson` written during replay, return-value shape `(envelope, structured_output)` |
| `test_phase_judge.py` | `phase_judge()` / `judge_capture()` — 3 verdicts written for 3-record NDJSON, INDEX.json content, schema validation, max_parallel semaphore bound, call_type filtering, empty/missing NDJSON edge cases |
| `test_heal_loop.py` | `HealState` save/load round-trip + atomic write; `heal_baseline()` — state.json + 6 verdict files for 2 samples n=3; `heal_apply_patch()` — patched prompts written per sample under iter-1/; `heal_replay_patched()` — history + best_so_far updated in state.json |
| `test_group_launcher.py` | `--group` fan-out arm and group-scoped ID-dispatched verbs: state-dir guard rejects `--state-dir` arg and `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` env before fan-out; each member child receives `--group-id <uuid>` and `--inspect-dir` for all sibling repos; brief content prepended to each member prompt; distinct per-member state dirs even with inherited env; non-git repo path rejected; `--status <group-id>` finds members across separate state dirs and excludes non-members; `--resume/--kill/--finalize <group-id>` dispatch across member state dirs; `--list --groups` groups `run.json` files by `group_id` across all `~/.leerie/*/` dirs; chain regressions: `--kill/--resume <chain-id>` still route to chain scope. Modeled on `tests/test_chain_launcher_id_dispatch.py`. |
| `test_group_launcher_verbs.py` | Group-scoped verb dispatch across two separate state dirs using a combined fixture (member A: paused/unpushed fly member; member B: pushed/done local member): `--status <group-id>` lists both run-ids and excludes non-group runs; `--list --groups` shows the shared group_id and member count; `--resume` dispatches only to the paused member; `--finalize` only to the unpushed member; `--kill` only to fly members without `killed_at`; `--stop` only to running fly members (no terminal state); dual-purpose-verb fallback: a group_id correctly routes via the group path when chain lookup returns empty; chain_id still routes via the chain path. Fills the `--stop` dispatch gap not covered by `test_group_launcher.py`. |
| `test_group_launcher_fanout.py` | `--group` fan-out core contract: one child per member is spawned with `cwd=<member-repo>`, `--group-id <uuid>` in argv, `--inspect-dir <sibling>` for every other member (not itself), and the shared brief text prepended to the member's prompt. Uses LEERIE_SELF_CMD stub-recorder to assert both cwd and argv per child. Complements `test_group_launcher.py` with focused assertions on the fan-out mechanics. |
| `test_group_run_json.py` | `group_id` in run.json Python-layer contract (DESIGN §20): `_validate_run_json` accepts `group_id`-bearing sidecars in every push/pause/kill state; `_write_run_json` persists and preserves `group_id` across incremental writes; `_derive_run_status` produces correct status for `group_id`-tagged runs (local-stub member without `fly_machine_id` and fly-stub member with `fly_machine_id`). |
| `test_group_state_dir_guard.py` | State-dir isolation for group members (DESIGN §20 *State isolation is free*): two members in repos with distinct basenames resolve to distinct `~/.leerie/<basename>/` dirs even when the parent's `LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR` is inherited; `--group` arm rejects `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` env and `--state-dir` CLI arg before any child spawns, preventing the `.owner`-collision failure mode. |
| `test_host_finalize_sh.py` | `scripts/host-finalize.sh` `host_finalize` contract via a bash-harness with stubbed `git`/`gh`: no-push / already-pushed idempotency, tip-aware re-push vs diverged-origin guard, completion gate (PR-#22), and the LLM-less **⚠ Deploy-ordering** fallback — the bash `jq` renderer emits the section from `state.json.external_preconditions` byte-identically to the Python `compose_pr_body` (DESIGN §20), and nothing when the field is absent/empty. |
| `test_repo_map.py` | `build_repo_map` (symbol/def extraction, class methods, ref edges, relative-path keys, empty-repo, skip-.git/node_modules), mtime cache (dir created, unchanged served from sentinel, changed re-parsed, only-changed re-parsed), `rank_repo_map` (string result, token-budget fits, seed-file/seed-symbol bias, empty map, determinism, tight budget), `_parse_repo_file` (unsupported extension, markdown, Python defs + refs), `_walk_calls` (bare call extracted, attribute call not extracted), `_pagerank` (dangling node, personalization, empty). |
| `test_build_repo_map.py` | HAS_TREESITTER-gated supplement to `test_repo_map.py`: symbol graph (defs, class defs, ref edge, keys shape, relative-path invariant), mtime cache (cache dir created, sentinel cache hit, changed file re-parsed, only-changed file re-parsed with sentinel for unchanged), graceful degrade (empty file, binary file, empty repo, skip-.git/node_modules). Uses a `pytestmark` module-level skip gate so CI without tree-sitter-language-pack skips all tests cleanly. |

Run with `pytest tests/` from the repo root. The full suite (~1700
tests across the deterministic-enforcement, bash-harness, and remote
lifecycle tiers) completes in roughly a minute end to end. The table
above lists a representative subset; the live count under `tests/`
is the authoritative inventory.

**CI surface.** GitHub Actions runs three independent workflows on every
pull request to `main` (and on pushes to `main`):

| Workflow | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | `pytest tests/ -ra` across Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12, with `pytest-cov` reporting line coverage to the job summary (no gate per CLAUDE.md). Coverage XML is uploaded as a 7-day artifact from the 3.12 job. Dev dependencies (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`) installed inline per CLAUDE.md's "pytest is the only dev dependency" stance. |
| `.github/workflows/syntax.yml` | The AST parse from CLAUDE.md's task-completion checklist, plus the same parse over every file under `tests/`. Path-filtered to `orchestrator/**/*.py` and `tests/**/*.py` for fast feedback ahead of the full pytest matrix. |
| `.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml` | `shellcheck -x scripts/*.sh` — the worktree mechanics scripts are load-bearing (DESIGN §6). Path-filtered to `scripts/**/*.sh`. |

Each workflow has a `concurrency:` block keyed on `github.ref` with
`cancel-in-progress: true`, so a force-push or rapid pushes do not
leave superseded jobs in flight. Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
tracks the GitHub-Actions ecosystem on a weekly cadence.

**Not tested.** No worker has run against a live `claude -p`. The flag
contract in §3 is from CLI documentation, not from observed runs. The
worker invocation function (`claude_p`) is not unit-tested because
meaningful testing requires a stub or live `claude` binary — that's a
separate end-to-end tier.

First real step: one run on a throwaway repo with a small, fully-specified
task.
