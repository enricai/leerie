# Leerie

**Leerie** is an autonomous task driver for Claude Code. One prompt. Finished, committed, validated code. No steering mid-run, no polishing when it's done.

Most tools that call themselves autonomous still require you: to confirm a direction, catch a hallucination, or clean up the result before it's usable. Leerie doesn't. It classifies the task, decomposes it, implements each piece in parallel isolated worktrees, validates the integrated result, and merges — beginning to end, unattended.

It runs entirely on the **Claude Code CLI and your existing subscription** — no Anthropic API key, no per-call billing. If you have Claude Code installed and logged in, you have everything it needs.

**Why it actually finishes without you:**

Most AI "orchestrators" let the model pilot: the model decides what to do next, declares when it's done, and judges whether it succeeded. That's where drift, hallucinated completion, and silent failures come from — and why you end up steering.

Leerie inverts the relationship. **The model writes code. The program runs everything else.** Phases, wave scheduling, retries, caps, merge logic, and success-criteria enforcement are ordinary Python — real loops and conditionals that cannot drift.

- **No silent failures.** Every worker output is JSON-schema-validated before the orchestrator acts on it. A worker cannot, by malformed output or confident hallucination, cause the system to do something undefined.
- **Confidence is the only hard gate.** The implementer self-gates on evidence-anchored confidence in `root_cause` and `solution` (≥9 on both, see DESIGN.md §8) — falsifiers tested, contradictions reconciled, gaps named with concrete artifacts. A worker that cannot justify the score exits `blocked` with the gap analysis. Everything else — tests passing, lint clean, build green, per-criterion satisfaction — is best-effort: surfaced as advisory warnings on the subtask result, never escalated to `failed` or `blocked` by the orchestrator. The criteria file is the implementer's working note, not a gate.
- **Workers must justify confidence with evidence, not feelings.** Before writing code, an implementer clears domain-specific evidence gates — file-and-line citations, reproductions, falsification attempts. A self-reported score without hard artifacts doesn't clear the bar.
- **Parallel work that's actually safe.** Each implementer gets an isolated git worktree. Parallel writes never collide. Conflicts surface one wave at a time, close to the work that caused them.
- **Resumable by design.** A reboot, network blip, budget cap, the Claude Code subscription rate-limit, Ctrl-C, or an external kill (SIGTERM from CI / systemd / a closed terminal) all lose nothing — the run branch is the durable record, worktrees are torn down, and `--resume` picks up from the last completed wave. When the subscription rate-limit hits and the reset time is unambiguously parseable, leerie even auto-resumes after the reset window without manual intervention. The explicit "throw this away" gesture is `scripts/cleanup.sh --run-id <id> --branches`, not Ctrl-C.
- **Parallel-safe across runs.** Multiple `./leerie` invocations in the same repository each get a unique `run_id` (a derived branch + state directory). Their branches, worktrees, and per-run state directories never collide. Launch a fix and a feature in parallel without coordination.

## How it works

The orchestrator is a Python program — not an in-session agent. It shells out
to `claude -p` (headless mode) for each unit of LLM work. Each call is a
separate process, so there is no subagent nesting anywhere. Control flow lives
in real Python: `for` loops, `if` statements, counters. It cannot drift.

```
leerie "<task>"
   ├─ Phase 1  Classify into 1..9 categories                    → 1 claude -p
   │             ↓ derive run_id (category + slug + start-hex)
   │           • Clarify — intent-only questions (optional; skipped for fully-specified tasks)
   ├─ Phase 2  Plan — one planner per category (parallel)        → N×3 claude -p (multi-sampled)
   │           • Decompose — repo-map-grounded recursive split into
   │             right-sized leaf subtasks (P6 + P1)             → fit_judge / splitter
   │           • Reconcile — cross-domain capability-tag bridging (0 or 1 claude -p, when needed)
   │           • Overlap-judge — cross-planner surface collisions (multi-planner runs only)
   ├─ Phase 3  Schedule — global dependency graph → topo waves   (topo-sort pure Python;
   │             a satisfied-probe drops already-done criterion-bearing subtasks → 1 claude -p each)
   ├─ Phase 4  Create leerie/runs/<run-id> branch + worktree (per-run unique)
   ├─ Phase 5  Per wave:
   │   ├─ Implement each subtask (parallel, isolated worktrees)  → claude -p each
   │   │     • self-gates on evidence-anchored confidence — the only hard gate
   │   │     • Conform — post-work doc/test/lint/build pass (advisory) → 1 conformer claude -p
   │   ├─ Integrate the wave into the run branch; on conflict    → 1 integrator claude -p
   │   └─ Validate the integrated run branch (conflict-marker scan)
   │         (after the final wave: one more conformer pass on the whole tree)
   └─ Phase 6  Push run branch; open PR against working branch; cleanup
               (working branch not modified locally)
```

For the full rationale — why the orchestrator is a script rather than a plugin
command, all architectural decisions, and the complete enforcement surface —
read [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Requirements

- `claude` CLI on `PATH`, logged in interactively
- For long or unattended runs, a long-lived `claude setup-token` OAuth
  token is recommended: export it as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` before
  launching. A container can't refresh a copied subscription token, so
  an interactive login alone can expire mid-run; the setup-token still
  bills against your subscription, not the API. See
  [`docs/DESIGN.md` §6 *Credential strategy*](docs/DESIGN.md) for why.
- `git`
- A git repository with `user.email` and `user.name` configured
- A reasonably clean working tree
- A container runtime (one-time setup — see *Install* below)
- `gh` CLI logged in (`gh auth status` succeeds), or pass `--no-push` to skip the finalize PR step

**Leerie runs inside a container** to give cleanup a hard kernel
guarantee: when you Ctrl-C, the Linux PID namespace is torn down and
every worker / build / test runner is reaped, even ones that detached
into their own POSIX sessions. See
[`docs/DESIGN.md` §6](docs/DESIGN.md) and
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` §0.5](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) for the
reasoning and mechanics. Python is provisioned *inside* the container
by the image; you don't need it on the host.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enricai/leerie/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer auto-installs and starts the container runtime per OS
(Colima on macOS via `brew`; containerd + pinned `nerdctl` on
Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL, and Arch via the distro package manager)
and then clones leerie into `~/.leerie` + symlinks `leerie` into
`~/.local/bin`. Sudo prompts apply on Linux. Full per-OS details and
the rootless / unsupported-distro paths live in
[`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md).

### Inside Claude Code (recommended for chat-based use)

```
/plugin marketplace add enricai/leerie
/plugin install leerie@enricai-leerie
```

Then in any Claude Code session:

```
/leerie Fix the login timeout bug and add a regression test
```

### Inspect before installing

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enricai/leerie/main/scripts/install.sh -o install.sh
bash install.sh --dry-run            # print actions without executing
bash install.sh                       # then run for real
```

Customize with `--prefix DIR` (default `~/.leerie`), `--bin-dir DIR`
(default `~/.local/bin`), or `--ref REF` (default `main`).

### Manual container-runtime setup

If you'd rather install the runtime yourself (CI, dotfiles managers,
or you want to pin a different `nerdctl` version), do the runtime
steps manually then pass `--no-runtime-install` (or set
`LEERIE_NO_RUNTIME_INSTALL=1`):

**macOS** (Colima manages a Linux VM):

```bash
brew install colima
# Size the VM at ~half your host's CPU/RAM (Colima's 2-CPU / 2-GB
# default OOMs under parallel leerie workloads — see docs/INSTALL.md
# for the auto-sizing the installer applies). On an 8/16 host:
colima start --runtime containerd --mount-type virtiofs --cpu 4 --memory 8
# Also add 4 GB of swap (paste the YAML block from docs/INSTALL.md
# "Memory pressure: swap configuration" into ~/.colima/default/colima.yaml,
# then colima stop && colima start). This step is optional but strongly
# recommended — without swap the VM OOMs under heavy parallel load.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enricai/leerie/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-runtime-install
```

(Do not `brew install nerdctl` — the formula requires Linux. Leerie
auto-installs the host-side `nerdctl` shim from Colima on first run.)

**Linux** (Debian/Ubuntu — see [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md)
for Fedora, Arch, and rootless setups):

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y containerd
NERDCTL_VERSION=2.3.1
ARCH="$(dpkg --print-architecture 2>/dev/null || uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/')"
curl -L "https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases/download/v${NERDCTL_VERSION}/nerdctl-${NERDCTL_VERSION}-linux-${ARCH}.tar.gz" \
  | sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xz nerdctl
sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enricai/leerie/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-runtime-install
```

### Manual (clone + run)

If you'd rather not run any installer at all:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enricai/leerie.git
./leerie/leerie "your task"   # or symlink onto PATH
```

The first invocation builds the container image (~60–120s); subsequent
runs reuse it. The container runtime must already be set up — see
[`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) for per-OS instructions.

## Usage

```bash
# From the root of the target git repository:
leerie "Fix the login timeout bug and add a regression test"
# (substitute leerie if you used the manual install)

# Or pass a path to a .txt / .md file whose contents are the task —
# useful for multi-paragraph briefs that are awkward to quote on the shell:
leerie path/to/task.md

# Resume an interrupted or budget-capped run. Auto-picks if exactly one
# in-flight run exists; otherwise pass the run-id (see `--list`).
leerie --resume
leerie --resume fix-login-timeout-bug-b81e90

# List in-flight and completed runs in this repository:
leerie --list

# Skip the default push + PR at finalize (run completes with the run
# branch local-only; your working branch is unchanged):
leerie "task" --no-push

# Skip pre-push hooks at finalize (the user's explicit override; defaults
# off). Affects only the final `git push`; worker commits still run hooks.
leerie "task" --no-verify

# Opt into intent questions (default: no questions are surfaced).
leerie "task" --clarify

# Pre-supply clarification answers (JSON object):
# Keys are question ids from the classifier, plus "source_of_truth"
# set to "codebase", "research", or "both".
leerie "task" --answers answers.json

# Override caps (defaults: 200 total workers, 5 in parallel per wave).
# --max-workers also reads LEERIE_MAX_WORKERS or max_workers in
# leerie.toml; --max-parallel also reads LEERIE_MAX_PARALLEL or
# max_parallel in leerie.toml.
leerie "task" --max-workers 80 --max-parallel 4
export LEERIE_MAX_WORKERS=80

# Dial how persistent the planner and implementer are at building
# confidence before they exit blocked (default 8 evidence-gate rounds
# inside each worker; see DESIGN §8):
leerie "task" --confidence-rounds 12
export LEERIE_CONFIDENCE_ROUNDS=12

# Override the default source-of-truth preference (`both`) — pass
# --source-of-truth on the command line for a one-off, set
# LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH for the session, or commit a leerie.toml
# at the repo root with the line `source_of_truth = codebase` (or
# research / both).
# Precedence (highest first): --source-of-truth > env > leerie.toml.
export LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH=codebase    # or: research, both
leerie "task" --source-of-truth codebase

# Choose the model. Without overrides, judgment workers (classifier /
# planner / reconciler / plan_overlap_judge / provision / integrator)
# default to opus and the acting
# workers (implementer, conformer) default to sonnet — see
# docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md §2 "Model selection" for the full env-var /
# CLI-flag / TOML-key table.
# Set LEERIE_MODEL=sonnet (or --model sonnet) to restore the
# pre-0.3 all-sonnet behavior in one knob.
export LEERIE_MODEL=sonnet                # or: opus, haiku
leerie "task" --model opus
leerie "task" --model-implementer opus --model-classifier haiku

# Optional but recommended — lower the auto-compaction threshold
# for worker processes (default is 95%):
export CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=70

# Chain orchestration: submit and track multi-run chains. A chain is
# N parallel `leerie --runtime fly` invocations per wave, with
# synth-merge between waves to build the next wave's base branch.
# The laptop is the sequencer; no Fly coordinator machine. No chain-
# specific env vars required — each per-job `--runtime fly`
# invocation has its own env requirements unchanged.

# Submit a new chain. Each --wave defines one wave (comma-separated
# prompt files). Waves execute in order; runs within a wave execute
# in parallel as separate Fly machines. N waves supported. The chain
# operates against $USER_REPO directly.
leerie --chain \
  --wave prompts/fetch.md,prompts/lint.md \
  --wave prompts/publish.md

# ID-dispatched verbs: UUID positional → chain scope (iterates
# run.json filtered by chain_id); Fly machine id → existing
# single-run scope.
leerie --status   <chain-id>   # render per-run states from run.json
leerie --attach   <chain-id>   # poll run.json files every 5s
leerie --stop     <chain-id>   # pause every running chain run
leerie --kill     <chain-id>   # destroy every chain run's machine
leerie --resume   <chain-id>   # resume every paused chain run
leerie --finalize <chain-id>   # push + open PR for every unpushed run
leerie --list --chains         # group runs by chain_id

# Deprecated --chain-* aliases (kept for backwards compat) shim to
# the new verbs above.

# Run-groups: launch N single-repo leerie runs together as a coordinated
# unit. Each member runs in its own state dir (basename-keyed), its own
# branch, and opens its own PR. Members share a group_id and read-only
# cross-repo visibility via --inspect-dir; the optional --brief file is
# prepended to every member's prompt.
leerie --group \
  --repo ../api     "add /volumes endpoint" \
  --repo ../frontend "add-disk dialog" \
  --brief group-brief.md          # optional shared brief

# Resubmit with an existing group_id (keeps the same group):
leerie --group --group-id <prior-group-id> \
  --repo ../api     "add /volumes endpoint" \
  --repo ../frontend "add-disk dialog"

# Group-scoped verbs (UUID → group scope across member state dirs):
leerie --status   <group-id>   # render per-member run states
leerie --stop     <group-id>   # pause every running member (Fly runtime only)
leerie --resume   <group-id>   # resume every paused member run
leerie --kill     <group-id>   # destroy every member run
leerie --finalize <group-id>   # push + open PR for every unpushed member
leerie --list --groups         # list all groups across state dirs
```

Inside Claude Code (after `/plugin install leerie@enricai-leerie`):

```
/leerie Fix the login timeout bug and add a regression test
```

## Configuration

Complete reference for every CLI flag, environment variable, and
`leerie.toml` key the orchestrator reads.

### CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `task` (positional) | — | The task description (literal string, or path to a `.txt`/`.md` file). Required unless `--resume`, `--list`, or `--phase` is given. |
| `--resume` | off | Resume an interrupted run. Auto-picks if exactly one run exists; pass the run-id if multiple. |
| `--run-id ID` | — | Select a specific run by id (e.g., for `--resume` or `--phase` when multiple runs are in flight). |
| `--list` | off | Enumerate in-flight and completed runs in this repository (run id, started, status, cost, branch). |
| `--no-push` | off | Skip the default push + PR at finalize. The run completes with the run branch local-only; your working branch is unchanged. Overrides `LEERIE_NO_PUSH` / `leerie.toml`. |
| `--no-verify` | off | Pass `--no-verify` to the finalize `git push` only (skips pre-push hooks). Worker commits inside worktrees still run all hooks. The user's explicit override per CLAUDE.md's hooks principle. |
| `--answers FILE` | — | JSON object of pre-supplied clarification answers (keyed by question `id`; may include `source_of_truth`). |
| `--clarify` | off | Opt into surfacing intent questions to the user. Default: questions are dropped after the classifier's codebase→research filter, and the implementer makes a documented best-effort decision. Also `LEERIE_CLARIFY` env var or `clarify = true` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--max-workers N` | `200` | Cap on total `claude -p` invocations across the run. Also `LEERIE_MAX_WORKERS` env var or `max_workers` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--max-parallel N` | `5` | Cap on concurrent workers within a wave. Per-worker cgroup containment keeps an OOM inside one worker's cgroup; users on smaller VMs can opt down. Also `LEERIE_MAX_PARALLEL` env var or `max_parallel` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--worker-memory-max SIZE` | auto | Per-worker cgroup memory cap (e.g. `4G`, `512M`). Bounds RAM the worker subtree may consume; OOMs stay inside the worker cgroup rather than cascading to sshd / orchestrator. Auto-derived from `/proc/meminfo` when unset (VM RAM / `max_parallel+1`, floored at 8 GiB). Also `LEERIE_WORKER_MEMORY_MAX` or `worker_memory_max` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--confidence-rounds N` | `8` | Evidence-gate rounds the planner and implementer may run before exiting blocked (DESIGN §8). Overrides `LEERIE_CONFIDENCE_ROUNDS` and `leerie.toml`. |
| `--skip-smoke` | off | Skip the live `claude -p` preflight smoke test. |
| `--source-of-truth VALUE` | `both` | `codebase` / `research` / `both`. Overrides `LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` and `leerie.toml`. |
| `--runtime VALUE` | `local` | `local` / `fly` / `ec2`. Execution backend for per-subtask worker containers. Overrides `LEERIE_RUNTIME` and `leerie.toml`. `--runtime ec2` provisions an EC2 instance, seeds it, and runs the orchestrator on it, mirroring `--runtime fly`; see `docs/INSTALL.md` "EC2 runtime" (requires `LEERIE_EC2_AMI` to name an AMI with the orchestrator already baked in). |
| `--aws-region VALUE` | none | AWS region leerie itself uses when provisioning `--runtime ec2` machines. Distinct from the AWS SDK's own `AWS_REGION` credential-chain var. Also `LEERIE_AWS_REGION` env var or `aws_region` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--aws-profile VALUE` | none | AWS profile leerie itself uses when provisioning `--runtime ec2` machines. Distinct from the AWS SDK's own `AWS_PROFILE` credential-chain var. Also `LEERIE_AWS_PROFILE` env var or `aws_profile` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--ec2-ami VALUE` | none (required for `--runtime ec2`) | AMI id for the `RunInstances` call. Also `LEERIE_EC2_AMI` env var or `ec2_ami` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--ec2-instance-type VALUE` | none (required for `--runtime ec2`) | EC2 instance type (e.g. `t3.large`). Also `LEERIE_EC2_INSTANCE_TYPE` env var or `ec2_instance_type` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--ec2-key-name VALUE` | none (required for `--runtime ec2`) | EC2 key-pair name for SSH access. Also `LEERIE_EC2_KEY_NAME` env var or `ec2_key_name` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--ec2-security-group VALUE` | none (required for `--runtime ec2`) | Security group id to attach. Also `LEERIE_EC2_SECURITY_GROUP` env var or `ec2_security_group` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--ec2-subnet-id VALUE` | none (required for `--runtime ec2`) | Subnet id to launch into. Also `LEERIE_EC2_SUBNET_ID` env var or `ec2_subnet_id` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--inspect-dir PATH` | none | Extra directory the inspect-bucket workers (classifier, planner, reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, provision) may read; forwarded to `claude -p` as `--add-dir`. Repeatable. Also `LEERIE_INSPECT_DIRS` (colon-separated) or `inspect_dirs` in `leerie.toml` (comma-separated). |
| `--model ALIAS` | per-worker (judgment: `opus`; acting workers — implementer, conformer: `sonnet`) | `sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`. Sets every worker this run; without it the per-worker defaults apply. |
| `--model-<worker> ALIAS` | per-worker default (`implementer`, `conformer` → `sonnet`; everything else → `opus`) | Per-worker override. `<worker>` is one of `classifier`, `planner`, `reconciler`, `plan_overlap_judge`, `provision`, `implementer`, `integrator`, `conformer`, `fit_judge`, `splitter`. Overrides `--model`, `LEERIE_MODEL`, and `leerie.toml`. |
| `--effort LEVEL` | per-worker (judgment: `high`; acting workers — implementer, conformer: inherit Claude default) | `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`. Reasoning-depth dial forwarded to `claude -p --effort`. Pins judgment workers to a consistent depth across runs to reduce same-job variance (e.g. planner subtask-count drift). IMPLEMENTATION.md §2 "Effort selection". |
| `--effort-<worker> LEVEL` | per-worker default (judgment workers → `high`; acting workers → inherit Claude default) | Per-worker override. `<worker>` is one of the orchestrator workers (same set as `--model-<worker>`). Overrides `--effort`, `LEERIE_EFFORT`, and `leerie.toml`. |
| `--judge-model ALIAS` | `sonnet` | Model alias for the post-run judge skill. Also `LEERIE_MODEL_JUDGE` or `model_judge` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--heal-model ALIAS` | `sonnet` | Model alias for the post-run self-heal skill. Also `LEERIE_MODEL_HEAL` or `model_heal` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--heal-max-rounds N` | `10` | Maximum heal-loop iterations per `call_type`. Also `LEERIE_HEAL_MAX_ROUNDS` or `heal_max_rounds` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--heal-success-threshold RATE` | `0.9` | Pass-rate threshold for the heal-loop SUCCESS verdict. Also `LEERIE_HEAL_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` or `heal_success_threshold` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--verbosity LEVEL` | `stream` | `quiet` / `normal` / `stream` / `debug`. Controls inline per-worker activity output; full per-worker stream is always saved to `<state-root>/logs/<sid>.log` (where `<state-root>` is the resolved state directory — default `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`). |
| `-v` / `-vv` | `0` (off) | Shortcuts that anchor to `normal`: `-v` = `stream`, `-vv` = `debug`. With no `-v` and no `--verbosity`, falls through to `LEERIE_VERBOSITY` / `leerie.toml` / default `stream`. |
| `-q` / `-qq` | `0` (off) | Shortcuts that anchor to `normal`: `-q` = `normal` (pre-streaming behavior), `-qq` = `quiet`. With no `-q` and no `--verbosity`, falls through to the same chain as `-v`. |
| `--judge-dir DIR` | `judge-out` | Subdirectory name under the run dir for LLM judge output. Also `LEERIE_JUDGE_DIR` or `judge_dir` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--heal-dir DIR` | `heal-out` | Subdirectory name under the run dir for LLM self-heal output. Also `LEERIE_HEAL_DIR` or `heal_dir` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--phase PHASE` | — | Run a post-run skill phase (`judge` or `heal`) against an existing run's captured LLM calls instead of starting a new run. Use `--run-id` to select when multiple runs exist. |
| `--report [RUN_ID]` | — | Print a read-only telemetry report for a run: per-call-type token/cost/latency/failure breakdown plus memory peak. Pass a run id, or omit to auto-pick when exactly one run exists. Exits without running orchestrate. |
| `--version` | — | Print `leerie <version>` and exit. |
| `--status STATE` | — | With `--list`, restrict the table to runs whose derived status matches STATE. One of: `seed-failed`, `corrupt-sidecar`, `in-progress`, `done`, `done-pushed-no-pr`, `done-pushed-pr`, `push-failed`, `pr-failed`, `paused`, `killed`, `sync-failed`. |
| `--skip-overlap-judge` | off | Skip the phase 2¾ plan-overlap judge (DESIGN §5). Auto-skipped on single-planner runs; this flag disables it on multi-planner runs. Also `LEERIE_SKIP_OVERLAP_JUDGE` or `skip_overlap_judge` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--skip-budget-check` | off | Skip the post-schedule budget-feasibility preflight (DESIGN §13). The runtime backstop in `State.bump_workers()` still fires. Also `LEERIE_SKIP_BUDGET_CHECK` or `skip_budget_check` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--skip-repo-map` | off | Skip the P6 repo-map structural context (DESIGN §5½ (P6)): suppresses `build_repo_map()` and the ranked subgraph injection into planner/splitter context; the planner degrades gracefully to the prior grep/glob-only path. Use on repos where tree-sitter cannot parse the primary language. Also `LEERIE_SKIP_REPO_MAP` or `skip_repo_map` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | off | Pass `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to every `claude -p` worker, including judgment workers that run in the real repo cwd. Waives DESIGN §12 read-only enforcement. Also `LEERIE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` or `dangerously_skip_permissions` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--pr-template NAME` | none | When the target repo has multiple PR templates in `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`, pick this one by basename (with or without `.md`). Also `LEERIE_PR_TEMPLATE` or `pr_template` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--pr-writer-model ALIAS` | `sonnet` | Model alias for the finalize-time PR title + body writer. Also `LEERIE_MODEL_PR_WRITER` or `model_pr_writer` in `leerie.toml`. |

### Launcher verbs

These flags are handled by the bash launcher before the container starts.
A summary appears in the `leerie --help` epilog; see below for full
details and sub-flags.

**Per-repo configuration (no container required):**

`leerie config` is a host-only fast path — it exits before `nerdctl run` and never starts a container.

| Verb | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `config` | Print the effective build/lint/test config for this repo, with `[config]` or `[inference]` provenance for each axis. Also shows `leerie.toml` operational knobs when present. |
| `config --init` | Create `.leerie/config.toml` with auto-detected BLT commands (uncommented) and a commented `setup_packages` example. Errors if the file already exists. Prints the path and suggests `git add .leerie/`. |
| `config --chat` | Open an interactive `claude` session with a config-generation system prompt and `--add-dir` pointing at the current repo. The model can read the repo and write `.leerie/config.toml` (and optionally `.leerie/Dockerfile`). |
| `config --recapture` | Host-only (no container). Consolidates across **all** finished runs' logs (not just the newest) and writes merged `setup_packages` / language-dep installs to `.leerie/config.toml` via the dep_capture LLM worker. Never-clobber union: already-captured runs (sentinel present) are skipped and only new packages/managers are added. |
| `config --recapture --force` | Re-runs the worker over runs already captured (drops the `dep_capture.done` sentinel) **and** wholesale-replaces the persisted `setup_packages` / `language_installs` from the fresh capture — deps no longer captured are dropped. An empty capture leaves the existing config untouched (never blanks a good config). Use to re-derive deps from current run history. |

**Lifecycle (remote mode):**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--stop <run-id> [--runtime local\|fly\|ec2]` | Pause a run — a remote Fly machine, an EC2 instance (`stop-instances`, preserving the root EBS volume), or a local container. Resumable via `--resume` (EC2 `--resume` calls `resume_instance()` and re-resolves the reassigned public IP). |
| `--kill <run-id> [--force]` | Destroy a remote machine permanently. `--force` skips confirmation. Also accepts `--machine-id <id> [--app <app>]` for orphan cleanup. |
| `--finalize <run-id> [--force] [--no-verify] [--no-push] [--runtime fly]` | Post-detach finalization: collect un-integrated subtask branches on the machine, fetch the run branch, then push + open PR on the host. Without `--force`, requires the orchestrator to be dead. `--force` SIGTERMs a live orchestrator first, then collects and fetches. |
| `--re-seed <run-id> [--force]` | Mid-run host→machine re-rsync of dirty delta. `--force` bypasses the safety check that refuses to clobber machine-side uncommitted edits. |

**Resume modifiers (used with `--resume`):**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--shell` | Drop into a bash shell at `/work` on the machine instead of tailing the orchestrator log. |
| `--auto-finalize` | On clean orchestrator exit, automatically run `leerie --finalize`. |
| `--no-re-seed` | Skip the automatic re-seed of dirty delta on resume. |

**Build and runtime:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--state-dir PATH` | Override the per-repo state directory. Also `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` env var or `state_dir` in `leerie.toml`. |
| `--fly-app NAME` | Fly.io app name (required for `--runtime fly`; globally unique). Also `LEERIE_FLY_APP` env var. |
| `--fly-disk-gb N` | Provision a Fly volume of N GB mounted at `/home/leerie`. Also `FLY_VM_DISK_GB` env var. |
| `--no-runtime-install` | Skip auto-install of container runtime (Colima / nerdctl / containerd). Also `LEERIE_NO_RUNTIME_INSTALL`. |
| `--no-auto-publish` | Skip the image-publish probe on startup. Also `LEERIE_NO_AUTO_PUBLISH`. |
| `--local-build` | Force local `nerdctl build` instead of the Fly remote builder. Also `LEERIE_LOCAL_BUILD`. |

### Environment variables and `leerie.toml` keys

| Env var | `leerie.toml` key | Description |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` | `state_dir` | Override the per-repo run state directory. Unset → default `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/` (outside the repo; no `.gitignore` entry needed in target projects). Cross-repo basename collisions are caught at use time via an `.owner` sidecar inside the dir. Set once in your shell profile for a global directory across all repos. |
| `LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` | `source_of_truth` | Sticky source-of-truth preference (`codebase` / `research` / `both`). Overridden by `--source-of-truth`. Unset → default `both`. |
| `LEERIE_RUNTIME` | `runtime` | Execution backend for per-subtask worker containers (`local` / `fly` / `ec2`). Overridden by `--runtime`. Unset → default `local`. |
| `LEERIE_MODEL` | `model` | Model alias applied to every worker. Overridden by `--model` and per-worker overrides. Unset → per-worker defaults (judgment workers `opus`, acting workers — implementer, conformer — `sonnet`). |

Overridden by `--model-<worker>`. `<worker>` ∈ `classifier`, `planner`, `reconciler`, `plan_overlap_judge`, `satisfied_probe`, `provision`, `implementer`, `integrator`, `conformer`, `fit_judge`, `splitter`. Unset → `implementer`, `conformer`, and `satisfied_probe` → `sonnet`; everything else → `opus`. |
| `LEERIE_EFFORT` | `effort` | Reasoning-depth dial forwarded to `claude -p --effort` (`low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`). Applies to every worker; overridden by `--effort` and per-worker overrides. Unset → judgment workers `high`, acting workers inherit Claude default. |

| `LEERIE_VERBOSITY` | `verbosity` | Inline-output verbosity (`quiet` / `normal` / `stream` / `debug`). Overridden by `--verbosity`. `-v` / `-vv` / `-q` / `-qq` shortcuts override both. Unset → default `stream`. |
| `LEERIE_NO_PUSH` | `no_push` | Sticky opt-out from push + PR at finalize (truthy → skip). Overridden by `--no-push`. `--no-verify` has no env/TOML mirror — it is a per-invocation override only. Unset → default `false` (push + PR happen). |
| `LEERIE_CLARIFY` | `clarify` | Sticky opt-in to surfacing intent questions to the user (truthy → on). Overridden by `--clarify`. Unset → default `false`. |
| `LEERIE_MODEL_JUDGE` | `model_judge` | Model alias for the post-run judge skill. Overridden by `--judge-model`. Unset → default `sonnet`. |
| `LEERIE_MODEL_HEAL` | `model_heal` | Model alias for the post-run self-heal skill. Overridden by `--heal-model`. Unset → default `sonnet`. |

| `LEERIE_WORKER_MEMORY_MAX` | `worker_memory_max` | Per-worker cgroup memory cap (e.g. `4G`, `512M`). Overridden by `--worker-memory-max`. Unset → auto-derived from `/proc/meminfo`. |
| `LEERIE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS` | `dangerously_skip_permissions` | Waive §12 read-only enforcement on judgment workers (truthy → on). Overridden by `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Unset → default `false`. |

| `LEERIE_MODEL_DEP_CAPTURE` | *(none)* | Model alias for the finalize-time dep_capture worker. Env var only — no per-worker CLI flag and no `leerie.toml` key (it still honors the global `model` key / `--model`). Unset → default `opus`. |
| `LEERIE_CAPTURE_DEPS` | `capture_deps` (`.leerie/config.toml` only — not `leerie.toml`) | Enable finalize-time dependency capture (truthy → on). Precedence: `LEERIE_CAPTURE_DEPS` > `.leerie/config.toml` > default `true`. Set to `false` / `0` to disable entirely. |
| `LEERIE_BAKE_LANGUAGE_DEPS` | `bake_language_deps` | Include a language-dep `COPY`+`RUN` layer in the auto-generated `.leerie/Dockerfile` (truthy → on). Precedence: `LEERIE_BAKE_LANGUAGE_DEPS` > `leerie.toml` > `.leerie/config.toml` > default `true`. Set to `false` for an apt-only bake. |
| `LEERIE_WORKER_DEBUG` | — | Enable debug-level logging injection (`DEBUG=*`, `ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug`) into worker processes. Truthy → on. |
| `LEERIE_FLY_APP` | — | Fly.io app name (globally unique). Required when `--runtime fly`. Set via env or `--fly-app`. Launcher-only. |

| `LEERIE_AWS_REGION` | `aws_region` | AWS region leerie itself uses when provisioning `--runtime ec2` machines — distinct from the AWS SDK's own `AWS_REGION` credential-chain env var. Overridden by `--aws-region`. Unset → default `None` (region selection left to the AWS credential chain). |
| `LEERIE_AWS_PROFILE` | `aws_profile` | AWS profile leerie itself uses when provisioning `--runtime ec2` machines — distinct from the AWS SDK's own `AWS_PROFILE` credential-chain env var. Overridden by `--aws-profile`. Unset → default `None`. |

### Precedence

- **Source-of-truth** (highest first): `--source-of-truth` →
  `LEERIE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH` → `leerie.toml` → default `both`.
- **Model** (per worker, highest first): `--model-<worker>` →
  `--model` → `LEERIE_MODEL_<WORKER>` → `LEERIE_MODEL` →
  `model_<worker>` in `leerie.toml` → `model` in `leerie.toml` →
  per-worker default (`implementer`, `conformer`, `satisfied_probe` → `sonnet`; everything
  else → `opus`). The judgment-vs-acting split keeps the
  most-frequently-invoked workers on the lower-cost model while
  every judgment step gets Opus-grade reasoning. To restore the
  pre-0.3 all-sonnet behavior in one knob, set `LEERIE_MODEL=sonnet`
  or pass `--model sonnet`.
- **Confidence rounds** (highest first): `--confidence-rounds` →
  `LEERIE_CONFIDENCE_ROUNDS` → `confidence_rounds` in
  `leerie.toml` → default `8`.
- **Verbosity** (highest first): `--verbosity` → `-v`/`-vv`/`-q`/`-qq`
  shortcuts (anchored to `normal`, not to the resolved default) →
  `LEERIE_VERBOSITY` → `verbosity` in `leerie.toml` → default
  `stream`.

See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §2 for the
rationale behind these orders and the full validation contract.

## Worker types

Leerie spawns eleven kinds of `claude -p` worker. Each is a separate
subprocess; there is no in-session agent nesting.

| Worker | Prompt source | Default model | Runs per task | Returns |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| `classifier` | `prompts/classifier.md` | opus | 1 | category set + intent questions |
| `planner` | `prompts/planner.md` | opus | one per category (parallel) | subtask list with deps |
| `reconciler` | `prompts/reconciler.md` | opus | 0, 1, or up to 3 (retried up to twice when its first attempt closes a dependency cycle or leaves unresolved tags) | eight arrays — `renames` / `added_provides` / `added_subtasks` / `conditional_drops` / `dropped_requires` (resolution; `conditional_drops` drops a planner-emitted consumer subtask whose own intent declares it conditional on an unresolvable in_plan precondition; `dropped_requires` removes an over-specified `requires` entry — an aggregate or coarser synonym of what the consumer itself provides — and ALSO plays a cycle-breaking role on retry); `dependency_edges` / `merged_subtasks` (cycle-breaking-only, used on retry when leerie's gates detect a cycle); `unresolvable` (escape hatch). DESIGN §5 |
| `plan_overlap_judge` | `prompts/plan_overlap_judge.md` | opus | 0 or 1 (phase 2¾, multi-planner runs only; auto-skipped on single-planner runs) | cross-domain surface overlap analysis. DESIGN §5 |
| `satisfied_probe` | `prompts/satisfied_probe.md` | sonnet | 0 or 1 per subtask (phase 3, before scheduling; skipped when `--skip-satisfied-check`) | `{satisfied: bool, evidence: str}` — soft-drops subtasks already met on the base tree. DESIGN §8 |
| `provision` | `prompts/provision.md` | opus | 0 or 1 (spawned only when the deterministic lockfile-detection table abstains — Java/Gradle, bare `pyproject.toml`, polyglot Makefile) | install recipe (argv-allowlisted) executed via `mise exec --`. See DESIGN §6½ |
| `implementer` | `prompts/implementer.md` | sonnet | one per subtask (per wave, parallel) | commits on a `leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/<subtask-id>` branch |
| `conformer` | `prompts/conformer.md` | sonnet | one per subtask, only on the implementer's success path | advisory `conformance_warnings` on the subtask result; doc/test/rule-fix commits prefixed `conformer:` on the same branch (DESIGN §9 *Post-work conformance*) |
| `integrator` | `prompts/integrator.md` | opus | on conflict during wave integration | resolved merge commit on `leerie/runs/<run-id>` |
| `fit_judge` | `prompts/fit_judge.md` | opus | 0 or more per subtask (P1 recursive decomposition — one per `recursive_decompose()` call) | P1 Task-Context Fit score (0–1) with rationale and diffuse analysis. DESIGN §5½ (P1) |
| `splitter` | `prompts/splitter.md` | opus | 0 or more per subtask (P1 recursive decomposition — coupled-minority path only; migration sweeps use deterministic `partition_files()`) | child subtask list with ids, titles, and success criteria. DESIGN §5½ (P1) |

Additionally, two post-run workers run outside the main orchestrate loop and are not in `WORKER_TYPES`:

- `pr_writer` (`prompts/pr_writer.md`, default sonnet) runs at finalize when the run will push — it produces the PR title and body. Overridable via `--pr-writer-model` / `LEERIE_MODEL_PR_WRITER`.
- `dep_capture` (`prompts/dep_capture.md`, default opus) runs at finalize (and on `--recapture` / next-run backstop) — it reads worker logs, decides what the repo needs across all languages, and writes `setup_packages` / `language_installs` to `.leerie/config.toml`. Overridable via `LEERIE_MODEL_DEP_CAPTURE`. See DESIGN §6½.

**Per-worker model defaults:** judgment workers (classifier, planner,
reconciler, plan_overlap_judge, provision, integrator, fit_judge, splitter)
default to Opus; the acting workers (implementer, conformer) and
`satisfied_probe` default to Sonnet — their job is concrete subtask
execution or lightweight per-subtask probing where throughput matters more
than broad-context judgment. To revert to the all-Sonnet pattern of earlier
versions, set `LEERIE_MODEL=sonnet` or pass `--model sonnet`. See
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §2 *Model selection*
for the full precedence table.

See [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) §7 for the worker contract and
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §3 for the invocation
surface (flags, timeouts, schema enforcement).

## Walkthrough

For worked end-to-end examples — from invocation through clarification,
wave execution, run-branch review, and merge; and for chain orchestration
(submitting, monitoring, and cancelling a multi-run chain) — see
[`docs/USAGE.md`](docs/USAGE.md).

## Documentation

Every Leerie document is reachable from this README. Architecture and code
surface:

- [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) — architecture, constraints, phase
  flow, the evidence-gated loop, deterministic enforcement
- [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) — code-surface
  reference (functions, caps, schemas, model / effort selection)
- [`docs/USAGE.md`](docs/USAGE.md) — worked end-to-end example
- [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) — per-OS container runtime setup
  (Colima on macOS, containerd + nerdctl on Linux), Fly.io prerequisites

Policy and process:

- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — development setup, task-completion
  checklist, PR conventions (and pointer to [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), the
  repo-local guidance for Claude Code)
- [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) — threat model and vulnerability reporting
- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) — Contributor Covenant

Post-run analysis skills (invoked via Claude Code, not the orchestrator
itself):

- [`skills/judge-llm-batch/SKILL.md`](skills/judge-llm-batch/SKILL.md) —
  score captured `claude -p` calls against a 3-dimensional accuracy rubric
- [`skills/llm-self-heal/SKILL.md`](skills/llm-self-heal/SKILL.md) —
  autonomous prompt-patch loop for failing call types

## Development

Tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # runtime deps — the suite imports them
pip install pytest jsonschema     # pytest is the only dev dependency
pytest tests/                     # from the repo root
```

The suite runs on the host Python and imports the orchestrator directly,
so the pinned *runtime* deps must be installed too — without them, tests
that exercise the auth/quota backoff fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No
module named 'tenacity'`. This mirrors what CI installs
(`.github/workflows/test.yml`).

The suite covers the deterministic enforcement functions, including a
coupling test that the retry-policy markers match the live check-function
strings. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §10 for
the test layout. The worker invocation path is not unit-tested (a stub or
live `claude` binary would be needed; out of scope for the current suite).

| `leerie` | Executable bash launcher — runtime preflight + `nerdctl run` (or Fly Machine provisioning when `--runtime fly`) |
| `Dockerfile` | Container image recipe — Debian 13 + Node + pnpm + `claude` CLI + baked orchestrator source. Built locally on first run, tagged `leerie:<VERSION>` |
| `fly.toml` | Fly.io Machine configuration — app name, region, vm sizing (4 cpu / 8 GB), `min_machines_running=0` (no warm pool) |

| `prompts/patch_generator.md` | System prompt: minimal prompt-patch proposal for the post-run self-heal loop |
| `prompts/pr_writer.md` | System prompt: finalize-time PR title + body author (invoked by `phase_finalize` when the run will push) |
| `prompts/fit_judge.md` | System prompt: P1 Task-Context Fit scorer — judges whether a subtask's scope and context are co-minimized (DESIGN §5½ (P1)); calibrated to 0.70 threshold |
| `prompts/splitter.md` | System prompt: P1 structural splitter — labels pre-partitioned migration chunks or emits structural seams for the coupled-minority case (DESIGN §5½ (P1)) |
| `prompts/config_chat.md` | System prompt: interactive `leerie config --chat` session — reads the repo's CI config and manifests, generates `.leerie/config.toml` and optionally `.leerie/Dockerfile` |
| `prompts/_clarification_filter.md` | Shared include (codebase→research→ask filter) inlined by `classifier.md` and `implementer.md` via `load_prompt`'s `{{include: …}}` expansion |
| `scripts/install.sh` | One-command `curl \| bash` installer (preflight → runtime preflight → clone → symlink → verify) |
| `scripts/runtime-install.sh` | Per-OS auto-install of the container runtime (Colima on macOS; containerd + nerdctl on Debian / Fedora / Arch). Sourced by `install.sh` and the launcher |
| `scripts/container-entry.sh` | Container PID 1 entrypoint — `cd /work` then either `exec sleep infinity` (no argv: remote/Fly path, the launcher exec's the orchestrator separately via `flyctl ssh console`) or `exec python3 /opt/leerie-image/orchestrator/leerie.py "$@"` (with argv: local nerdctl path) |
| `scripts/setup-run.sh` | Create per-run branch + worktree (`leerie/runs/<run-id>`) |
| `scripts/new-worktree.sh` | Create per-subtask branch + worktree off the run branch |
| `scripts/integrate.sh` | Merge a subtask branch into the run branch |
| `scripts/finalize.sh` | Verify the run branch is non-empty and ready to push. The working branch is never modified locally. The push + `gh pr create` step lives in the **host launcher** (bash + `jq`) and runs after `nerdctl run` exits cleanly, using the host's own auth state — see [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §7 *Host-side finalize*. Skipped when `--no-push` is set. |
| `scripts/host-finalize.sh` | Host-side push + PR creation block. Sourced by three call sites: the local-runtime post-run code path in the launcher, `decide_teardown` in `scripts/remote/provision.sh` (Fly clean-exit auto-finalize), and `leerie --finalize <run-id>` (recovery fast-path). Provides `host_finalize <run-dir>`; uses `pr_title` / `pr_body` from `run.json` when the `pr_writer` worker populated them, otherwise falls back to a deterministic body. |
| `scripts/cleanup.sh` | Remove worktrees for one run (default `--run-id`) or all runs (`--all-runs`). State dir always preserved as audit. `--branches` also deletes the matching `leerie/runs/<id>` run branch *and* `leerie/subtasks/<id>/*` subtask branches. `--subtask-branches` deletes only the subtask branches and keeps `leerie/runs/<id>` (the post-finalize default — the run branch is the PR head). |
| `scripts/remote/_log.sh` | Shared `remote_log()` helper — timestamped, repo-tagged stderr lines. Sourced by every other `scripts/remote/*.sh` file so all Fly-mode output is uniformly labeled. |
| `scripts/remote/build-push.sh` | Build and push a self-contained leerie image to Fly.io's registry (source baked in at `/opt/leerie-image/`). Default mode is Fly's remote builder (no host Docker daemon required); `--local-build` / `LEERIE_LOCAL_BUILD=1` opts into the legacy nerdctl/docker path. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §0.5 *Registry publish path*. |
| `scripts/remote/provision.sh` | Fly Machine lifecycle helper (sourced by the launcher's `RUNTIME=fly` branch). Provides `provision_machine()` (create → wait-started → register `decide_teardown` trap), `stop_machine()`, `destroy_machine()`, and `decide_teardown()` (classifies `$LEERIE_REMOTE_EXIT_RC`; on clean exit runs `fetch_branch` BEFORE `destroy_machine` so no work is lost; on sync failure leaves the machine RUNNING with `sync_failed_at` written for user-driven recovery; on pause-worthy non-zero rc stops the machine). See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §7 *Machine lifecycle*. |
| `scripts/remote/lib.sh` | Shared bash helpers sourced by `provision.sh`, `resume-machine.sh`, and `re-seed.sh`. Provides `update_run_json()` (atomic merge into the run sidecar) and `wait_for_started()` (poll Fly Machine status until ready). |
| `scripts/remote/resume-machine.sh` | Resume helper for paused remote runs. Reads `fly_machine_id` from the sidecar, runs `flyctl machine start`, waits for `started`, and clears `paused_at`/`pause_reason`. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §7. |
| `scripts/remote/seed-auth.sh` | Worker auth + config seeding (sourced by the launcher after `provision_machine()` returns). Provides `seed_auth()`, which tar-pipes `~/.claude.json` + `~/.claude/` (with `.claude/local` excluded — duplicates the Dockerfile-installed claude CLI) to `/home/leerie/` via `flyctl ssh console -C "tar -xC ..."`, writes git identity to `/home/leerie/.gitconfig`, and pre-warms `claude --version` once so the orchestrator's preflight call hits warm caches. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §7 *Worker auth + config seeding*. |
| `scripts/remote/seed-repo.sh` | Single-channel git-aware repo seeding helper (sourced by the launcher after `provision_machine()` succeeds). Provides `seed_repo()`: wipe `/work` contents (preserving the inode), then tar-pipe a git-aware payload — `git ls-files -z --cached --others --exclude-standard` (honors `.gitignore`) + `.git/` verbatim + the repo's local `.claude/` verbatim (force-included) − `.leerie/` (defensively excluded; run state lives outside the repo at `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR`, not in-repo) — to `/work` on the machine. No in-machine `git clone`; the host has the repo, and Fly machines deliberately receive no GitHub credentials. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §7 *Repo seeding*. |
| `scripts/remote/re-seed.sh` | Mid-run re-rsync helper (Phase 4). Wakes a paused machine, runs a safety check, and re-runs `seed_repo_dirty`. Invoked by `leerie --re-seed <run-id>` and the auto-re-seed step on `--resume --runtime fly`. |
| `scripts/remote/fetch-branch.sh` | Post-run stream-back helper (sourced by `decide_teardown` BEFORE `destroy_machine` on clean exit, and by the `leerie --finalize` fast-path). Provides `fetch_branch()`: discovers the completed run-id on the machine, probes whether the run branch actually exists (skipping the bundle for cleared-but-empty terminal-state runs), streams the `leerie/runs/<run-id>` git bundle to the host via `git fetch`, tars `.leerie/runs/<run-id>/` back, and strips the mechanism-flag `no_push` from the host-side run.json (the user's intent lives in `fly-machine.json` as `host_no_push`). See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §7 *Run branch stream-back*. |
| `scripts/remote/aws-credentials.sh` | Standalone AWS credential/profile/region resolution helper for the EC2 runtime. Provides `resolve_aws_credentials()`: resolves credentials and region host-side in the same precedence order the AWS CLI/SDKs use — explicit `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars, then a named profile (`--profile` / `AWS_PROFILE` / `default`) via static credentials or cached SSO token, ending with an actionable error rather than a silent fallthrough (no IMDS instance-role fallback — this runs on the operator's host, not on an EC2 instance). Pure file I/O against `~/.aws/config`, `~/.aws/credentials`, and `~/.aws/sso/cache/*.json` + bash/python3 stdlib — no `aws` binary or boto3 dependency, mirroring the existing `detect_bedrock_mode()`/`bedrock_preflight()` precedent in the launcher. Sourced by the launcher's `RUNTIME=ec2` branch and by `leerie --stop --runtime ec2`, both of which call `resolve_aws_credentials` and export its resolved credentials/region before `ec2-lib.sh`'s `require_aws()` preflight runs. |
| `scripts/remote/ec2-lib.sh` | Shared bash helpers for the EC2 lifecycle, parallel to `scripts/remote/lib.sh`'s role for the Fly path. Provides `require_aws()`: the host-side preflight the launcher's `RUNTIME=ec2` branch calls before provisioning (also called by `leerie --stop --runtime ec2` before pausing), modeled on `require_flyctl()`'s two-stage shape (binary present? → authenticated?) — checks `command -v aws` (actionable install hint if missing, no auto-install) and probes `aws sts get-caller-identity` (with a resolved `--profile`), reusing `bedrock_preflight()`'s exact `aws sso login --profile <profile>` recovery-hint vocabulary on failure. Also provides `resolve_ami()`/`resolve_instance_type()`/`resolve_key_name()`/`resolve_security_group()`/`resolve_subnet_id()`, one required-var read per `LEERIE_EC2_*` var. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)'s Files table. |
| `scripts/remote/ec2-seed-repo.sh` | EC2 counterpart to `scripts/remote/seed-repo.sh` (DESIGN.md §6 *EC2 runtime lifecycle*, "Seed" row). Same `.gitignore`-aware payload logic (bundle for committed state + porcelain-filtered dirty-delta rsync, `.leerie/` excluded except the three whitelisted config files, shallow-vs-full-bundle threshold) as the Fly path — only the transport differs: `ec2_tar_pipe` (plain `ssh`) for bulk bundle/tar data, `ec2_remote_exec` (SSM Session Manager) for small instance-side commands. Provides `ec2_seed_repo_clone()`, `ec2_seed_repo_dirty()`, and the wrapper `ec2_seed_repo()`. Consumes a new `LEERIE_EC2_SSH_TARGET` env var (the resolved `ssh`-destination for the instance, populated by `ec2-provision.sh`). See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)'s Files table. |
| `scripts/remote/ec2-provision.sh` | The `provision.sh` counterpart for the EC2 lifecycle (DESIGN.md §6 *EC2 runtime lifecycle*). Exports `provision_instance()`, `wait_for_instance_ready()`, `stop_instance()`, `terminate_instance()`, `decide_ec2_teardown()`. Sourced by the launcher's `RUNTIME=ec2` run-launch dispatch and by the `leerie --stop --runtime ec2` (`stop_instance()`) and `leerie --kill --runtime ec2` (`terminate_instance()`, with fetch-before-terminate ordering) paths. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)'s Files table. |
| `scripts/remote/ec2-resume-instance.sh` | Resume helper for paused EC2 runs — the EC2 counterpart to `scripts/remote/resume-machine.sh`. Exports `resume_instance()`: starts a `stopped` instance (idempotent no-op if already `running`), waits on `wait_for_instance_ready()`, re-resolves `LEERIE_EC2_SSH_TARGET` from the instance's current public IP (EC2 assigns a new one on every stop/start cycle), re-arms the `decide_ec2_teardown` trap, and clears `paused_at`/`pause_reason` on the run sidecar. Never terminates the instance or deletes its volume on any path. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)'s Files table. |
| `scripts/remote/ec2-fetch-branch.sh` | EC2 counterpart to `scripts/remote/fetch-branch.sh`, sourced by `ec2-provision.sh`'s `_try_fetch_state_for_ec2_teardown()` hook before `terminate_instance()`. Exports `fetch_state_ec2()`: same four steps as `fetch_branch()` (run discovery, git-bundle stream-back, run-state tar stream-back, best-effort never-clobbering `.leerie/config.toml`/`Dockerfile` stream-back) — transport substituted to `ec2_remote_exec` (SSM, small commands) plus a private binary-safe `ssh` download helper (`_ec2_fetch_ssh`) for bulk data, since `ec2_tar_pipe` is upload-only. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)'s Files table. |
| `scripts/remote/ec2-ssm.sh` | SSM Session Manager transport substitution for `flyctl ssh console`'s launch/attach roles (DESIGN.md §6 *EC2 runtime lifecycle*; the stream-back role is `ec2-fetch-branch.sh`, already shipped). Wired into the launcher's `RUNTIME=ec2` dispatch. Exports `ec2_launch_detached()` / `ec2_attach()`: both bootstrap a short `python3 -`/`sh -s` invocation via `AWS-StartInteractiveCommand` and pipe the real (potentially multi-KB) payload through the session's stdin, since SSM's `--parameters` document parameter is capped at ~4 KB. See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)'s Files table. |

## Safety

Acting workers use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. That is a real risk
surface — it is what makes the run unattended. It is bounded by **two
isolation layers**: (1) worktree isolation — each worker operates in its
own isolated git checkout, not your main working tree; (2) the container
the orchestrator runs in — PID-namespace + cgroups bound every worker
subprocess inside the per-run container (see
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) §6 and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)).
These bound the blast radius; they do not eliminate it. **Run on
repositories you trust and review the run branch (`leerie/runs/<run-id>`)
before relying on the result.** Push + PR at finalize is the natural
review surface; you can also pass `--no-push` to keep finalize fully
local.

The run writes only to `<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/` (where `<state-root>`
is the resolved state directory — default `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`,
overridable via `LEERIE_STATE_DIR` / `--state-dir` / `leerie.toml state_dir`;
never inside the repo itself) and to `leerie/runs/<run-id>` plus
`leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/<subtask-id>` branches. Phase 6 (unless
`--no-push`) pushes the run branch to `origin` and opens a PR against
your working branch — your working branch itself is never modified
locally. After a run, the run branch (`leerie/runs/<run-id>`) is kept
as an audit trail; per-subtask branches are auto-deleted at finalize,
but each worker's commits remain reachable from the run branch's
`--no-ff` merge graph (`git log leerie/runs/<run-id> --graph`). Remove
the run branch (and any leftover subtask branches) with
`scripts/cleanup.sh --run-id <id> --branches` (or `--all-runs --branches`
for an audit cleanup across every past run).

## Troubleshooting

- **`claude: command not found`** — Leerie shells out to the Claude Code
  CLI; install it from https://claude.ai/code and confirm with
  `claude --version`. There is no fallback path.

- **Exits with code 10** — not an error. Leerie needs clarification
  answers and you are running non-interactively. Read
  `<state-root>/pending-questions.json`, write the answers to
  `<state-root>/answers.json`, then `./leerie --resume --answers <state-root>/answers.json`
  (where `<state-root>` is the resolved state directory — default `$HOME/.leerie/<basename>/`).
  The plugin skill at `commands/leerie.md` handles this relay
  automatically when invoked as `/leerie`.

- **Run interrupted (Ctrl-C, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, CI cancel, terminal close, reboot)** —
  worktrees are torn down but state.json + branches are preserved.
  Resume with `./leerie --resume` (auto-picks the most recent resumable
  run) or `./leerie --resume <id>`. Run `leerie --list` to see
  what's in flight. The explicit "throw this away" command is
  `scripts/cleanup.sh --run-id <id> --branches` — Ctrl-C alone is
  always safely resumable.

- **Run hit the Claude Code subscription rate-limit** — leerie detects
  the session-limit message from `claude -p` and exits cleanly.
  Worktrees are torn down; state and branches are preserved. A
  rate-limit resets on a clock, so leerie auto-resumes: when the reset
  time can be parsed unambiguously it sleeps until the reset window;
  when it cannot (malformed time, unfamiliar timezone, or a future
  format change) it sleeps a fixed backoff (5 min) and re-resumes,
  polling until the limit clears. Ctrl-C during the wait drops to a
  manual `--resume`. Auto-resume passes only `--resume <id>`; CLI-only
  overrides (`--model`, `--max-workers`, etc.) on the original launch
  are *not* preserved across an auto-resume. Set those via env
  (`LEERIE_*`) or `leerie.toml` if you want them to survive — both
  channels are re-resolved on every `--resume`.

- **Run hit an expired OAuth session ("OAuth session expired")** — the
  host's interactive login token expired mid-run and a container can't
  refresh a copied one. Leerie detects this as terminal (distinct from
  the rolling rate-limit above) and pauses resumably at exit code 75
  rather than dying: worktrees are torn down, state and branches are
  preserved. Fix it immediately with `claude /login`, then
  `./leerie --resume <id>`. To avoid this class of failure entirely on
  long or unattended runs, mint a durable token with
  `claude setup-token` and export it as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` before
  launching — see *Requirements* above.

- **Run ran out of credits** — distinct from a rate-limit: credits
  don't reset on a clock (they return on a top-up or billing cycle), so
  leerie does *not* auto-resume. It tears down worktrees, preserves
  state and branches, prints an `out of credits — leerie --resume <id>`
  hint, and exits with code 75. Add credits, then re-run that `--resume`
  command. (An org with "extra usage" disabled at the org level is *not*
  out of credits — that's a benign standing state and never triggers
  this pause.)

- **A subtask reports `blocked`** — the implementer hit something it
  cannot resolve and bailed before integration. Read the blocker reason in
  `<state-root>/runs/<run-id>/state.json` under `blocked[<subtask-id>]`, address the
  upstream cause, then resume. See [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) §8
  for the evidence-gated loop.

- **Worktree or branch conflicts on a re-run** — `scripts/cleanup.sh --run-id <id> --branches`
  removes that run's worktrees and deletes its branches so a fresh run
  with the same task starts clean. For a global sweep across every past
  run, use `--all-runs --branches`. Then re-invoke as normal.

- **Push or PR failed at finalize** — the run completed locally. Check
  `leerie --list` for the run's status (`push-failed` / `pr-failed`)
  and read `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<run-id>/run.json` for the captured stderr.
  The error message at finalize names the exact retry command. Local
  commits are intact on the run branch.

## FAQ

**Do I need an Anthropic API key?**
No. Leerie runs entirely on the Claude Code CLI and your existing
subscription. The orchestrator shells out to `claude -p` workers; no API
key is read or sent.

**Can I run multiple Leerie instances in the same repository?**
Yes. Each invocation derives a unique `run_id` and namespaces all of its
state under `$LEERIE_STATE_HOST_DIR/runs/<run-id>/` and its branches under
`leerie/runs/<run-id>` (run branch) and `leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/<sid>`
(subtask branches) — so parallel runs in the same clone never collide.
Use `--list` to see what's in flight and `--resume <id>` to
resume a specific one.

**Does Leerie work outside a git repository?**
No. Per-subtask isolation is provided by `git worktree`; the worktree
mechanism is load-bearing, not optional.

**What if my project has no test runner?**
That's fine — running tests is advisory only (DESIGN §9 *Post-work
conformance*). When `_infer_build_lint_test()` finds no test command,
the conformance phase reports the test axis as not-applicable and
surfaces no warning. The subtask's terminal status is determined by the
implementer's confidence gate (DESIGN §8), not by whether tests ran.
See [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) §5 for the
conformance phase's advisory contract.

**Can I see what each worker did?**
Yes. Every worker commits to its own `leerie/subtasks/<run-id>/<subtask-id>`
branch during the run; at finalize, those branches are auto-deleted, but
the integrator merges each one into the run branch with `--no-ff`, so
every worker's commits remain reachable from `leerie/runs/<run-id>` as a
named merge bubble. `git log leerie/runs/<run-id> --graph` is your
per-worker audit trail. When you no longer need the run branch either,
`scripts/cleanup.sh --run-id <id> --branches` removes it (and any
leftover subtask branches); `--all-runs --branches` removes all of them.

**Why not use the Claude Code SDK or the in-session Agent tool?**
Two platform constraints make subprocess workers the right shape. See
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) §2.
