# Why a gate rather than adding jq to the image: the host/container split is
# deliberate. Host bash uses `jq` — the launcher hard-fails at preflight
# without it (`leerie`'s "jq not found on PATH" check, which tells you to
# `brew install jq`) — while code that runs *inside* the container uses
# python3, exactly as `scripts/remote/seed-auth.sh` documents: "python3 over
# jq because jq isn't in the leerie image (see Dockerfile)".
#
# The gated modules source scripts the host owns (`host-finalize.sh`,
# `provision.sh`'s `decide_teardown`, the launcher's finalize path) and stub
# `git`/`gh` on PATH but not `jq`, so they silently inherit it from whichever
# machine runs pytest. They pass on a dev host and in CI (both ship jq) and
# fail only inside `leerie:<version>` — where the scripts under test could
# never succeed anyway, since gh auth, ssh-agent, and Keychain are all
# host-side (DESIGN §6 *Finalization*).
#
# Do NOT "fix" a skip here by installing jq into the image: that buys a green
# tick, not working code, and erodes the boundary.
